Follow the latest US media newshereor read about today’s settlement in the updates below.\nIn a statement made Tuesday after Fox News settled the defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems, Fox said:\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.”\nSo, what did those rulings say?\nThis is about the topic of falsity. To win a defamation case, you need to prove a few things. Most importantly, you need to prove the statements were false and that they were made with actual malice, otherwise known as a reckless disregard for the truth.\nIn amajor pretrial ruling on March 31, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled Dominion had successfully proven that all 20 statements mentioned in its lawsuit against Fox were false.\nDominion Voting Systems’ co-lead counsel Justin Nelson said he and Dominion’s other attorneys were expecting to go to trial against Fox News on Tuesday.\nThe final deal to settle the case with the right-wing network for $787.5 million came late in the day, and the settlement papers with Fox were signed just “minutes” before the agreement was announced, he said.\nPrior to the last-minute settlement, Nelson told CNN he and other attorneys had been preparing opening statements – even during the two-and-a-half-hour courtroom delay after the lunch recess.\nFox News will pay more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems after lawyers from both sides hammered out a last-minute settlement of the defamation case launched against the right-wing network.\nThe dealwas announced hours after the jurywas sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\nCNN’s Bill Hennessy, court sketch artist, captured scenes from inside the courtroom:\nDominion Voting Systems had two goals in its defamation case against Fox News — accountability and “trying to make Dominion whole,” said Justin Nelson, the lead counsel election technology company.\nBoth were accomplished in this settlement, he told CNN on Tuesday.\nThe payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the network’s statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was “a strong message of accountability” and an important victory for the employees of his client’s company.\nWhile the settlement does not stipulate that Fox’s anchors must acknowledge the lies on air, Nelson said it was a consequential outcome for the network.\nThe texts and emails that emerged during the litigation process from inside the Fox network were valuable, he said. “And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if you’re telling lies.”\nPrevious court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox Newsprivately ridiculed claims of election fraudin the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air.\nHe said the settlement with Fox sends a “strong message” to other right-wing outlets in which Dominion has ongoing legal disputes.\nFox News’ payment of $787.5 million to Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\nNotably, in 2017,ABC News paid$177 million after its years-long legal dispute with South Dakota-based meat processor Beef Products Inc. over its textured meat product that the network referred to as “pink slime.”\nAt the time, the settlement was believed to be the biggest amount ever paid in a media defamation case in the United States.\nFox News anchors will not have to acknowledge on-air that it told election lies about Dominion Voting Systems as part of the terms ofits settlement, a representative for the election technology company told CNN.\nFox News did acknowledge in its statement that falsehoods were broadcast.\nBut top anchors at the right-wing talk channel will not be required as part of the settlement to acknowledge on air the lies broadcast in the wake of the 2020 election.\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion,”  said the company CEO John Poulos on Tuesday, following the last-minute $787.5 million settlement with the right-wing network.\nSmartmatic, the voting technology company that is suing Fox News for $2.7 billion for defamation said its pending case will further expose wrongdoing by the right-wing network, following the last-minute settlement inthe case brought by Dominion Voting Systems.\nThe settlement for more than $787 million with Fox News represents “a ringing endorsement for truth and accountability,” the attorney representing Dominion Voting Systems said Tuesday.\nNelson said that more than two years ago a “torrent of lies” had swept Dominion and election officials across America, causing “grievous harm to Dominion and the country.”\nNelson also said the country must “remain ever vigilant to find common ground.”\nThe $787.5 million settlement in the Fox-Dominion case is an unequivocal rebuke of the right-wing news network and its journalism, said Elie Honig, former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n“Translated it means we got caught lying by the judge – and I think that’s exactly why we are seeing this absolutely jaw-dropping number,” Honig told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\nAlthough the amount is about half of what Dominion was asking for, it’s still an astonishing sum, he said.\nDominion Voting Systems still has pending lawsuits against right-wing networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell.\nAll of these parties and entities deny wrongdoing and are fighting the lawsuits.\nFollowing the announcement of a $787.5 million dollar settlement in the Fox News-Dominion case, John Poulos, the CEO of Dominion Voting Systems, said Fox News “admitted to telling lies” about the company.\n“Nothing can ever make up for that,” Poulos added at a news conference following court.\n“I cannot thank the election officials that we serve enough. Without them, there is no democracy,” he said.\nFox News has issued a statement on its settlement with Dominion Voting Systems acknowledging that some of the right-wing network’s on-air statements about Dominion were false.\nFor context:The statement was referring toJudge Eric Davis’ recent rulingthat 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\nThe settlement between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems totals $787,500,000, according to Dominion attorney Justin Nelson.\nThe settlement represents “vindication and accountability,” Nelson said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon.\n“The truth matters, lies have consequences,” Nelson said\n“Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories, causing grievous harm,” Nelson added.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis praised both sides after they abruptly settled the defamation case between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems at the last second.\nHe said, “I have been on the bench since 2010… I think this is the best lawyering I’ve had, ever.”\n“I would be proud to be your judge in the future,” Davis said, his final words before leaving the bench.\nThe hearing is now over. The case is now over.\nA last-second settlement has been reached in Dominion Voting Systems’historic defamation lawsuitagainst Fox News, the parties announced Tuesday in court.\nThe settlement was apparently brokered while the trial was on the brink of opening statements in Wilmington, Delaware.\nAfter swearing in the jury earlier Tuesday, an unexplained hours-long delay paused proceedings in court, which yet again triggered rampant speculation that a deal was quietly in the works.\nDetails of the settlement were not immediately available and might never become public.\nMore on the case:In its lawsuit, Dominion sought $1.6 billion in damages from Fox News. The right-wing network argued vociferously in pretrial proceedings that this number was inflated anddidn’t come closeto accurately capturing the potential losses that Dominion could have suffered as a result of Fox’s 2020 broadcasts.\nFox News and Fox Corporation — its parent company, which was also a defendant — say they never defamed Dominion, and say the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. They denied Dominion’s claim that they promoted these election conspiracies to save their falling ratings after the 2020 election.\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a secondmajor defamation lawsuitfrom Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was smeared on Fox shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.\nThe Fox-Dominion trial has resumed, after an unexplained delay of more than two hours.\nThe unexplained delay in the Fox News-Dominion defamation trial has surpassed 90 minutes.\nMoments ago in court, CNN observed a top Fox lawyer showing a piece of paper —presumably a note — to a top Dominion lawyer.\nA few minutes later, they both stepped out of the courtroom, into a private, secured area for court staff. Moments later, they walked back into court together. It is not known what they privately discussed, if anything.\nThe lawyers — Fox attorney Dan Webb and Dominion attorney Justin Nelson —subsequently huddled at Dominion’s table for a few minutes, in public view. They were talking to each other, but it is not known what they are saying.\nBoth men are now sitting at their respective tables, looking at their phones.\nThis comes ahead of the expected opening statements in the $1.6 billiondefamation trial against Fox News.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis has formally named a special master to investigate whether Fox News withheld evidence from Dominion Voting Systems, according to court filings.\nCNN reported last weekthat the judge was likely to launch this inquiry, which revolves around whether Fox intentionally suppressed evidence that it was legally obligated to provide to Dominion. The dispute escalated after audiotapes emerged of Fox host Maria Bartiromo talking to Rudy Giuliani in 2020.\nThe order, which was posted on the docket earlier in the day as jury selection began in the trial, directed attorney John Elzufon to lead the inquiry. Elzufon previously served as special master to handle routine evidentiary issues in the case.\nElzufon is required to finish his probe and submit a report by May 15.\nThe judge’s order indicates that the special master has the power to take depositions as part of his inquiry – and the special master will be allowed to depose anyone he thinks is appropriate.\nFox is required to pay for all expenses related to the investigation, according to Davis’ order.\nFox lawyers say they never withheld anything from Dominion, and that when new evidence emerged at a late stage, they turned it over as quickly as possible.\nThe court in theDominion-Fox defamation trialreconvened as planned at 1:30 p.m. ET in Wilmington, Delaware, after a lunch break, but there has been an unexplained slowdown in the proceedings.\nThe trial has not yet moved to opening statements, though that is expected next.\nLawyers for both sides have been present in the courtroom since things reconvened about one hour ago.\nThey have been looking at their phones, talking among their colleagues and waiting.\nThe jury is not inside the courtroom.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "full_news": "The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.\nThe judge overseeing the defamation trial has alreadyruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.”\nAt trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.\nFox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 8, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\nKey false quote: “Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,” Bartiromo said.\n“That’s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,” Powell said. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.”\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. They were founded as a company to fix elections, they have a terrible record, and they are extremely hackable,” Giuliani said.\nThe broadcast:“Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 13, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\nKey false quote: “Let’s start with Dominion, a straight out disavowal of any claim of fraud against the company, its software or machines. Your reaction,” Dobbs asked.\nRelated articleWhat to know ahead of the Fox News and Dominion trial\n“Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said.\n“We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added.\n“Well, that’s straightforward,” Dobbs said. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.”\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “Did you know a foreign company, DOMINION, was counting our vote in Michigan, Arizona and Georgia and other states,” Giuliani wrote.\n“Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 14, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\nKey false quote: “It was created for the express purpose of being able to alter votes and secure the reelection of Hugo Chavez and then Maduro. They’ve used it in Argentina,” Powell said. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.”\n“Yes. And hopefully the Department of Justice, but who knows anymore,” Pirro said.\nThe broadcast: “Fox & Friends Sunday” on November 15, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\nKey false quote: “Sidney Powell is also talking about potential kickbacks that government officials, who were asked to use Dominion, actually also enjoyed benefits to their families,” Bartiromo said. “We’re going to talk about that coming up as well.”\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 15, 2020.\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\nKey false quote: “We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed.

        "headline": "Judge in Fox News-Dominion defamation trial: 'The parties have resolved their case'",
        "full_news": "Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end acolossal two-year legal battlethat publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility.\nFox News’ $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\nThe deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\n“The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin.\nThe right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring toDavis’ recent rulingthat 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\nThe $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominioninitially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.\nThewitness listincluded Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway.\nRupert Murdoch thoughtthe election denialism was “really crazy,” even as Fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers. Carlson said he“passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and  “mind-blowingly nuts.”\nThese revelations generatedmonthsofblisteringheadlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. By settling now, Fox deprived Dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks-long trial.\n“This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards,” Fox said in a statement Tuesday. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\nFox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms.\nSpeculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced aone-day delayto the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday.\nThejury selection processwrapped up as planned Tuesday morning, and both sides prepped for opening statements. They even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations. But when the proceedings didn’t promptly resume after lunch, the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute, even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom, looking at their phones, and waiting.\nThe racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court, ready for their front-row seat to a historic trial. But Davis, the judge, instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement.\n“Your presence here, short compared to what you thought, and uneventful in a certain sense, was extremely important,” Davis said. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.”\nMany on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself.\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.\nRelated articleTucker Carlson 'passionately' hates Trump, and eight more key revelations about Fox News from new Dominion filings\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing asecond major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.\nFor its part, Dominion still has pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell. They all deny wrongdoing.\nCNN’s Liam Reilly and Danny Freeman contributed to this story.",

        "headline": "Millions in the US could face massive consequences unless McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he set for Biden",
        "full_news": "Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out ofa debt traphe has set forPresident Joe Bidenthat is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans.\nThe California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy.\nMcCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.\nRelated articleLawmakers return to Washington as debt limit crisis and other key issues loom\nThis is where the risk to Americans comes in. It’s hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes.\nMost countries don’t require the legislature to raise the government’s borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default.\nAt least, that’s the way it has worked until now.\nMcCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since it’s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate.\nBut in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members.\nRep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts.\n“I don’t know what’s in the package completely. That’s the issue,” Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.”\nIt is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. “The question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? We’ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House,” he added. “So we’ll have the first opening offer here. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.”\nMcHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit\nIn effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support.\nStill, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday he’d have the votes to pass his initial bill.\n“I think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling,” McCarthy told CNN. “We’ve got a lot of consensus within the conference. We’ll get together and work through it.”\nRelated articleHouse Republicans in talks over one-year debt ceiling plan in push to challenge White House\nHis assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into afarcical processthat saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams.\nBut with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans’ livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthy’s immediate political ambitions, that are on the line.\nSo far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOP’s position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain.\n“I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?”\nRelated articleHouse GOP escalates defense of Trump with New York field hearing seeking to discredit Manhattan DA\nAnother complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy’s narrow majority – secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.\nThe coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies.\nThere is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits – even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden’s big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis.\nBut are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthy’s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.\nIn order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff.\nHe tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasn’t a default but rising national debt.\n“Without exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, it’s irresponsible,” he said.\nPrevious fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction.\nMcCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why he’s trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake.\nMcCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the government’s borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default – especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But it’s hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown.\nThe White House twisted that particular knife on Monday.\n“There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said.\nRepublicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leaderMitch McConnelldid at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall.\n“President Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House,” McConnell said, though notably didn’t volunteer to get involved.\nMcCarthy’s speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil.\nAs Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”\nCNN’s Melanie Zanona, Morgan Rimmer, Haley Talbot and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

        "headline": "White homeowner accused of shooting a Black teen who rang his doorbell turns himself in to face criminal charges",
        "full_news": "The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said.\nAndrew Lester, who facestwo felony charges– assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. CNN has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information.\nLesterturned himself in at a detention centerTuesday then hours later was released on bail. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd.\nRalph, 16, was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. He has beenreleased from a hospitalbut faces an arduous road to recovery, his family said.\nLester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door.\nCNN has not been able to reach the homeowner. CNN has yet to determine whether Lester has an attorney.\nThe criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN.\n“It’s not as simple as turning a page,” Spoonmore said Tuesday. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.”\nBut questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting.\n“In Missouri, you can have a 24-hour hold. It is clear here that this was two or three hours, where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening.”\nLester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN.\nLester thought Ralph was trying to break in to the home and was “scared to death” due to the boy’s size, according to the document.\nOfficers responded just before 10 p.m. that night after receiving reports of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Ralph wounded in the street.\nIt was “nothing short of a miracle” that Ralph was discharged from the hospital, his attorney Ben Crump told CNN on Monday. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.”\nThe shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories ofTrayvon MartinandAhmaud Arbery– young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense.\nDemonstrators have marched through Kansas City chanting, “Justice for Ralph,” and calling for the shooter’s arrest.\nThe shooting also came days beforea 20-year-old woman was shot and killedin upstate New York after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway.\nRelated articleA 20-year-old woman was shot and killed after accidentally turning into the wrong driveway in upstate New York, officials say\nWhile Ralph’s attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter, it remains unclear whether Missouri’s “stand your ground” law will be cited in Lester’s defense case.\n“Stand your ground” laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\nRalph’s aunt challenged the notion that her nephew’s “size” could be a threat.\n“I really don’t understand how,” Spoonmore said. “I doubt Ralph is even 170 pounds. Ralph is not even 6 feet (tall).”\nShe said she’s on a mission to help get justice for her nephew.\n“I want justice to look the same across the board,” Spoonmore said. “I want justice to look the same.”\nThe mayor said he believes Ralph was racially profiled by the shooter.\n“This boy was shot because he was existing while Black,” Lucas said.\nClay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson has said, “There was a racial component to this case,” but did not elaborate.\nOn the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN.\nLester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done, Thompson said.\nAttorney Crump questioned why Lester was not detained longer.\n“Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head,” Crump told CNN.\n“He merely rang the doorbell. That was it,” the teen’s attorney said. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.”\n“We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said.\n“That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.”\nBefore the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement.\nHe then went to his home’s front entrance, which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door – both of which were locked.\nLester opened the interior door and “saw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle,” Lester told police.\n“He stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door,” the probable cause statement reads.\n“He believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in,” the document reads.\nLester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting, according to the document.\nPolice spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace.\nWhen he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says.\nWhile the teenager was still on the ground, the man then fired again, shooting him in the arm, Ralph told police.\nRalph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot, and he heard the man say, “Don’t come around here,” the document says.  He then went to multiple nearby homes asking for help and telling people to call police.\nRelated articleHow Trayvon Martin's life and death inspired a generation to fight for justice\nThe boy told police he did not pull on the door, according to the probable cause document.\nResponding officers also found the front storm door glass at Lester’s home broken, with blood on the front porch and the driveway, according to the document.\nThe teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” aGoFundMepage started by Ralph’s aunt states.\nA neighbor, who asked not to be identified, told CNN she called 911 after Ralph came to her door, bleeding.\nSince the shooter’s location was unknown at the time, she was directed to stay inside her home by the emergency operator for her safety. She said she complied initially, then went outside with towels to help suppress the bleeding.\n“This is somebody’s child. I had to clean blood off of my door, off of my railing. That was someone’s child’s blood,” she said. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.”\nRalph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said.\n“He and his family are just happy that he’s alive after being shot in the head,” Crump told CNN.\nMerritt said Tuesday the first bullet traveled less than five feet into Yarl’s upper temple and penetrated his skull.\nHe said God was telling the community and its leaders they cannot go on as business usual.\n“That was in fact a miracle. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.”\nRalph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to theGoFundMepage.\nRelated articleFor Black residents of Ahmaud Arbery's hometown, trust in the justice system is on trial right alongside his accused killers\n“Life looks a lot different right now. Even though he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally. The trauma that he has to endure and survive is unimaginable,” the aunt wrote in the fundraiser.\nThe GoFundMe page, started to help the family with medical expenses, had garnered more than $2 million in donations by Monday night.\nCrump likened Ralph’s shooting to the shootings of 17-year-oldMartinin Florida and 25-year-oldArberyin Georgia.\n“We continue to fight to say you can’t profile and shoot our children, just because you have this ‘stand your ground’ law,” Crump said. “Unacceptable.”\nMerritt told CNN Monday that the “stand your ground” action would not apply to Ralph’s case.\n“The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said.\nPresident Joe Biden spoke with Ralph and his mother, Cleo Nagbe, by phone on Monday evening, a White House official told CNN.\nBiden also noted how “fortunate” Ralph is that his mother is not just a nurse, but also a physical therapist.\nThe conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.\n“The president also committed to keeping up his fight against gun violence,” the official said.\nCNN’s Arlette Saenz, Steve Almasy, Chris Boyette and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

        "full_news": "A tiny intruder infiltrated White House grounds Tuesday, prompting a swift response from the US Secret Service.\nAnthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service, said a toddler crawled through the fence on the north side of the White House, setting off security alerts.\n“The Secret Service Uniformed Division today encountered a curious young visitor along the White House north fence line who briefly entered White House ground,” Gugliemli said. “The White House security systems instantly triggered Secret Service officers and the toddler and parents were quickly reunited.”\nIt’s not the first time a toddler has crawled through the White House fence. There was asimilar incident in 2014when a toddler squeezed through the White House fence just before then-President Barack Obama was about to address the nation on Iraq. The breach prompted a temporary lockdown and delayed the briefing.\n“We were going to wait until he learned to talk to question him, but in lieu of that, he got a timeout and was sent on way with parents,” Edwin Donovan, then a spokesman for the United States Secret Service, said.",

        "full_news": "Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that modelsdata through 2018.\nRelated articleDiabetes rates may surge in US young people, study finds\n“Our study suggests poor carbohydrate quality is a leading driver of diet-attributable type 2 diabetes globally,” says senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University and professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston, in a statement.\nAnother key factor: People are eating far too much red and processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, salami and the like, the study said. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.\nIn fact, the study estimated 7 out of 10 cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide in 2018 were linked to poor food choices.\n“These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of theTufts Health & Nutrition Letter.\nMozaffarian and his team developed a research model of dietary intake between 1990 and 2018 and applied it to 184 countries. Compared with 1990, there were 8.6 million more cases of type 2 diabetes due to poor diet in 2018, the study found.\nRelated articleBlueberries have joined green beans in this year's Dirty Dozen list\nResearchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eatingwholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents.\nOver 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice.\nInadequate intake of five protective dietary factors — fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and yogurt — was responsible for just over 39% of the new cases.\nRelated articleBest diet for 2023 is the science-backed Mediterranean style of eating\nPeople in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet.\nColombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.\n“Our modeling approach does not prove causation, and our findings should be considered as estimates of risk,” the authors wrote.",

        "headline": "ADHD medication abuse in schools is a 'wake-up call'",
        "full_news": "At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found.\n“This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\nRelated articlePrescriptions for ADHD treatments surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, CDC report shows\n“In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.”\nNonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication withalcohol or other drugsto boost a high,prior studieshave found.\nStudents also overuse medications or “use a pill that someone gave them due to a sense of stress around academics — they are trying to stay up late and study or finish papers,” said pediatrician Dr. Deepa Camenga, associate director of pediatric programs at the Yale Program in Addiction Medicine inNew Haven, Connecticut.\n“We know this is happening in colleges. A major takeaway of the new study is that misuse and sharing of stimulant prescription medications is happening in middle and high schools, not just college,” said Camenga, who was not involved with the study.\nPublished Tuesday in the journalJAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.\nIn the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools.\nRelated articleAdderall users struggle with ongoing shortage while reason -- and resolution -- remain uncertain\nSchools with the highest rates ofteens using prescribed ADHD medicationswere about 36% more likely to have students misusing prescription stimulants during the past year, the study found. Schools with few to no students currently using such treatments had much less of an issue, but it didn’t disappear, McCabe said.\n“We know that the two biggest sources are leftover medications, perhaps from family members such as siblings, and asking peers, who may attend other schools,” he said.\nSchools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study.\nSchools with more White students and those who had medium levels of student binge drinking were also more likely to see teen abuse of stimulants.\nOn an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis.\nIn addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared withpeers who had never used stimulants, the study found.\n“But these findings were not being driven solely by teens with ADHD misusing their medications,” McCabe said. “We still found a significant association, even when we excluded students who were never prescribed ADHD therapy.”\nData collection for the study was through 2020. Since then,new statisticsshow prescriptions for stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most age groups.  At the same time, there has been a nationwide shortage of Adderall, one of the most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patientsunable to fill or refill their prescriptions.\nThe stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say.\nRelated articleThe benefits of 'body doubling' when you have ADHD, according to experts\nIf overused or combined with alcohol or other drugs, there can be sudden health consequences. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nResearch has also shown people who misuse ADHD medications are highly likely to havemultiple substance use disorders.\nAbuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents arediagnosed and prescribedthose medications — studies haveshown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said.\nFor children with ADHD who use their medications appropriately, stimulants can be effective treatment. They are “protective for the health of a child,” Camenga said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.”\nThe solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed.\n“Instead, we need to look very long and hard at school strategies that are more or less effective in curbing stimulant medication misuse,” he said. “Parents can make sure the schools their kids  attend have safe storage for medication and strict dispensing policies. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.”\nFamilies can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added.\nParents and guardiansshould always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.\n“Finally, if parents suspect any type of misuse, they should contact their child’s prescriber right away,” McCabe said. “That child should be screened and assessed immediately.”",

        "full_news": "Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservativefailed to discloseluxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear.\nRelated articleClarence Thomas to amend financial disclosure forms to reflect sale to GOP megadonor\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.”\n“I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said.\nOther Democrats on the committee said Tuesday that they were deferring to Durbin, who huddled with Democrats on Monday evening to discuss their strategy towards Thomas.\nMeanwhile, Republicans appear mostly united in defending the Thomas, suggesting the court can handle its own affairs.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.”\n“The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday.\nBringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. In recent years, the conservative majority has handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights, dismantling gun regulations and reining in the powers of executive branch agencies – all prompting outcry from Democrats.\nEven as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary.\n“I’m disturbed by the recent reports detailing potentially unethical – even potentially illegal conduct – at the highest levels of our judiciary,” Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said at a Judiciary Committee hearing for three lower court nominees on Tuesday. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.”\nDurbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act.\n“The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday.\nBack-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures.\nThomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow.\n“If the reports are accurate, it stinks,” Sen. Mitt Romney said Monday evening, in rare comments from a Republican criticizing Thomas’ lack of transparency.\nOther Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 – and said it wasn’t Congress’ place to push an ethics code on the high court.\nRelated articleGOP revolts against plan to replace Feinstein on key panel in push to block Biden judicial picks\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.”\nThis is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases.\nYet Republicans have shown little interest in joining Democrats in using legislation to impose an ethics code on the justices.\n“The Court, kind of historically I think, has sort of policed itself,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.”\n“Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN Tuesday. “I prefer them to do it internally.”\nCNN’s Manu Raju, Lauren Fox, Ted Barrett, Ali Zaslav, Nicky Robertson, Morgan Rimmer and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

He will be held there until at least May 29 and faces a prison sentence of up to 20 years on espionage charges that the US has strongly condemned.\nCalling the lack of regular consular access for Gershkovich “appalling,” the senior administration official said that the US hasn’t heard “specific” concerns about the conditions of the US national’s detention, but said that his detention writ large is “inhumane.”\nThe US State Department hasofficially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detainedby Russia. “I think the starting point for our position on this, including engaging with the Russians, but also for helping the world to understand what’s happened, is that this just should never have been this way in the first place,” the official said, adding that officials are “still figuring out exactly where all of this goes” in terms of negotiations.\nLast week, Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said that the Russians have not indicated what they would want in exchange for the release of Gershkovich.\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that so far there is no evidence China is providing lethal military aid to Russia.\n“Our message is very clear: It would be a big mistake to support President [Vladimir] Putin’s illegal war,” he added.\nThe relationship between Russia and China:China hasclaimed neutralityover the war in Ukraine and called for peace in the conflict. But it has also refused to condemn Russia’s invasion or make any public call for Russia to withdraw its troops. The leaders of both countriesmet in March.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the head of US forces in the Indo-Pacific warned of the partnership between Russia and China, telling lawmakers it is “pretty concerning.”\n“They have no friends,” Adm. John Aquilino, commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, told the House Armed Services Committee. “They have identified that it is better if they’re together in order to achieve their strategic objectives. That’s a concerning world.”\nAquilino added that the relationship ties “directly” the question of misinformation and disinformation.\nCNN’s Haley Britzky contributed reporting to this post.\nThe investigator from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) who led the investigation into American MarinePaul Whelanin Russia is also investigating the case of detained Wall Street Journal reporterEvan Gershkovich.\nFSB investigator Alexei Khizhnyak was named as an investigator for Gershkovich’s case during a hearing at the Moscow City Court on Tuesday.\nGershkovich is currently being held in a pre-trial detention center at the notorious Lefortovo prison after he was arrested in late March. His appeal against his detention wasdenied earlier todayand he faces up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The Wall Street Journal has vehemently denied the spying accusations against Gershkovich. The US State Department hasofficially designated the journalist as wrongfully detainedby Russia.\nWhelan, a former Marine who is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.\nNATO allies need to give more weapons and supplies to Ukraine, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday.\nReferring to the informationcontained in leaked United States documentsthat suggests Ukraine may soon run out of air defense ammunition, Stoltenberg said military aid is going to be critical in helping Ukrainians take back positions.\nSwedish vodka brand Absolut Vodka will once again stop exporting to Russia, a spokesperson for Absolut’s parent company Pernod Ricard confirmed to CNN.\nExports of the vodka had been suspended when the war started but Pernod Ricard renewed exports of some of its brands, including Absolut, to Russia at the end of last year, the spokesperson said.\nThe decision to do so prompted backlash in Sweden, where Absolut is produced.\nDurroux said since March 2022, in compliance with international sanctions and local legal restrictions, “activity in Russia has been strongly reduced and marketing investments have been stopped. By ensuring the economic viability of its distribution subsidiary through limited supply, Pernod Ricard has been able to protect its local team from any local criminal liability, relating to ‘intentional bankruptcy’ in particular.”\nShe went on to say the company has a “duty of care towards our employees and partners, we cannot expose them to massive criticism in all forms.”\nTheleaked Pentagon documentsare not impacting the actions of NATO allies when it comes to Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told CNN Tuesday.\n“We have all seen that some of these leakages are incorrect and manipulated,” he said. “I don’t think they will impact what NATO allies are doing when it comes to Ukraine.”\nFact check:CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. They contain a wide range of highly classified information – providing a rare window into how the US spies on allies and adversaries alike. Some of the documents, whichUS officials say are authentic, expose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine.\nPoland has reached an agreement on restarting the transit of Ukrainian grains through its territory from Friday, according to government officials.\nKyiv is awaiting official communication from the Polish side on the technical aspects of transporting the products, Ukraine’s Minister of Economic Development and Trade Yulia Svyrydenko said.\nThe announcement comes following Ukraine-Poland negotiations in Warsaw on Tuesday.\n“We treat the problems faced by our Polish colleagues with the same attention Poland treats our problems. Therefore, we must respond promptly and constructively to this crisis situation,” she said, according to a statement released by Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy.\nSome background:Poland banned imports of grain and other food products from Ukraine “to protect the Polish agricultural market against destabilization,” the Polish Prime Minister’s office said in a statement over the weekend.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine it blocked ports and sea routes used to export Ukrainian grain to Africa and the Middle East. In response, the European Union lifted duties on grain from Ukraine to ease distribution to those global markets.\nUkrainian grain has since flowed into Poland but much of it has remained in the country, bringing down the price and causing Polish farmers to suffer significant financial losses.\nCNN’s Mayria Knight and Jonny Hallam contributed reporting to this post.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is set to discuss theBlack Sea grain dealwith United Nations Secretary General António Guterres when he visits New York next week, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Tuesday citing Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN.\nOn Monday, Ukraine accused Moscow of threatening the UN-brokered grain deal — which aims toease a global food crisissparked by the war — and said that the inspections of ships in Turkish territorial waters were blocked for the second time. Russian state news agency RIA reported inspections under the grain deal had resumed on Tuesday, citing Pyotr Ilyichev, director of the department for international organizations at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nLavrov’s trip to New York was made possible after Russian Ambassador to US, AnatolyAntonov, urged Washington last week to issue a permitfor the foreign minister’s special aircraft and visas for the Russian delegation to chair the UN Security Council meeting in New York.\nIn response, a State Department spokesperson said last week that as a host country of the UN, the United States takes its obligations under the UN Headquarters Agreement seriously, “including with respect to visa issuance.”\nThe agreement states, “the federal, state or local authorities of the United States shall not impose any impediments to transit to or from the headquarters district of: (1) representatives of Members or officials of the United Nations, or of specialized agencies as defined in Article 57, paragraph 2, of the Charter, or the families of such representatives or officials.”\nThe Russian foreign ministry has summoned the US, Canadian and UK ambassadors “in connection with gross interference in the affairs of the Russian Federation and activities that do not correspond to diplomatic status,” the ministry said as quoted by state-owned news agency RIA Novosti.\nWhat the ministry told US diplomat:The ministry issued a “strong protest” to Tracy on Tuesday for statements of support for jailedKremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza.\nIn a statement, the ministry also accused the US envoy of violating the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and threatened to end her stay in Moscow ahead of schedule if she abused her status.\n“It was especially noted that any steps by the American side aimed at inciting discord and enmity in Russian society, as well as using the diplomatic mission to cover up subversive work, will be severely suppressed,” the ministry said.\nA US State Department spokesperson confirmed Tracy met Russian officials at the foreign ministry on Tuesday, but would not provide details about what was discussed. “As a general rule, we do not discuss diplomatic discussions,” the spokesperson said.\nWhat the ministry told British diplomat:British Ambassador to Moscow Deborah Bronnert was summoned following “provocative statements” over the sentencing of Kara-Murza, the ministry said.\nThe UK condemned the sentencing Monday, calling it “politically-motivated.” The UK also summoned the Russian ambassador.\nRussia’s foreign ministry said in the statement that it regards “calls of foreign diplomats to cancel the verdict of the Russian court” as “gross interference” in internal affairs.\nRussia’s foreign ministry has not released a statement regarding the summoning of the US and Canadian ambassadors so far.\nCNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this post.\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Tuesday that they have not seen Russia deploy tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus yet, despite claims from Moscow that they intended to do so.\nStoltenberg said that Moscow’s threatened deployment “is part of a pattern we have seen actually [for] many years — but especially since the invasion of Ukraine — of dangerous, irresponsible nuclear rhetoric.”\nNATO is monitoring the situation closely, Stoltenberg said.\nSherman echoed Stoltenberg’s comments. She said that Russia has yet to move weapons to Belarus but called the threat “a dangerous escalation, no doubt about it.”\nSome background:In March, Putin told state media that Moscow will complete the construction of a special storage facilityfor tactical nuclear weaponsin Belarus by the beginning of July. He said an Iskander short-range missile system, a device which can be fitted with nuclear or conventional warheads, had already been transferred to Belarus.\nBelarus is one of Putin’s closest allies and was used as a launching pad for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine, and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month.\nIn the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.”\nGoods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests.\nThe Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. The plant has frequently been disconnected from Ukraine’s power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.\nWhile the plant is still physically operated by Ukrainian staff, Rosatom manages it. The Energy Department warned Rosatom in the letter that it is “unlawful” for any Russian citizens or entities to handle the US technology.\nCNN has reached out to Rosatom for comment.\nIt is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. The Energy Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration told CNN in a statement that the letter is authentic.\nThe letters were first reported by the news outlet RBC Ukraine.\n“The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\nShe added, “The Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorizing the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.”\nAnother letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.”\nThe Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, andstated on its website in June 2021that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.\nCorrection:This post incorrectly described the news outlet which first reported the letters. It was RBC Ukraine.\nThe UK’s top defense officialcast doubton the veracity and impact of the recently leaked US intelligence documents — some of which contain information about the war in Ukraine — going further than US officials have in questioning the contents of the hundreds of pages of classified intelligence that were posted online.\nUK Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace declined to comment on specific subjects in the documents. Speaking to journalists in Washington, DC, he acknowledged that some of the information “might be a bit compromising, might be a bit difficult for a number of nations” but expressed confidence that the leak won’t have significant effects.\nWhile members of the US government — from President Joe Biden to his top national security officials — have repeatedly said they are taking the leak seriously, engaging with allies to smooth things over and referring to the Justice Department’s ongoinginvestigation, Wallace was more dismissive and said he wouldn’t “be the only one who would look at those reports and see they’re not entirely accurate.”\n“I know for a fact having read what I’ve seen in the open source that some of those assertions are untrue,” Wallace said on Tuesday.\nAside from aclearly doctored documentthat changed Russian and Ukrainian casualty numbers, American officials have largely not expressed doubt about the legitimacy of the leaked documents, most of which have “top secret” or “secret” headings.\nWallace is in the US this week for meetings at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill.\nRemember:Last week,Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old airman with the Massachusetts Air National Guard, was charged under the Espionage Act with unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information and unauthorized removal of classified information and defense materials in connection to the leak.\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

        "full_news": "Two Russian men who claim to be former Wagner Group commanders have told a human rights activist that they killed children and civilians during their time inUkraine.\nUldarov, who appears to have been drinking, details how he shot and killed a five- or six-year-old girl.\n“(It was) a management decision. I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way,” he said.\nAccording to Gulagu.net, the testimonies were given to founder and Russian dissident Vladimir Osechkin over the span of a week. It said Uldarov and Savichev were in Russia when they spoke.\nRelated article'Just to survive': Wagner fighters recount the horrors of battle in eastern Ukraine\n“I want Russia and other nations to know the truth. I don’t want war and bloodshed. You see I’m holding a cigarette in this hand. I followed orders with this hand and killed children,” Uldarov said, describing his motivation for the interview.\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private mercenary organization fighting in Ukraine, headed by Russian oligarchYevgeny Prigozhin.\nIt hasrecruited tens of thousands of fightersfrom Russian jails,offering freedom and cashafter a six-month tour. It’s estimated by Western intelligence officials and prison advocacy groups that between 40,000 and 50,000 men were recruited.\nUldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities ofSoledarand Bakhmut – which have seen some of thefiercest fighting– Wagner mercenaries “were given the command to annihilate everyone.”\n“There is a superior over all the commanders – it’s Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone,” he added. CNN haspreviously reportedon former Wagner fighters making similar claims.\nAt one point in the interview, Savichev described how they “got the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.”\nHe also talked about getting orders to ‘sweep’ a house. “It doesn’t matter whether there is a civilian there or not. The house needs to be swept. I didn’t give a f**k who was inside,” he said.\n“Whether a hut or a house, the point was to make sure that there wasn’t a single living person left inside,” he said. “You can condemn me for this. I will not object. It’s your right. But I wanted to live, too.”\nRelated articleOpinion: How the battle for Bakhmut exposed Russia's 'meat-grinder'\nSavichev said Wagner fighters who did not follow orders were killed.\nBut Prigozhin said that “if none is confirmed, I will send a list of 30-40 people who are spitting at me like Osechkin (there is a whole list of them, including the scum that fled Russia) that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine is obligated to hand over to me for a ‘fair trial,’ so to speak.”\n“They will not be “civilians” for us, and especially not children, whom we have never touched and do not touch. This is a flagrant lie. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.”\nEarlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: “Regarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.”\n“Russian terrorists confessed to numerous murders of Ukrainian children in Bakhmut and Soledar. Confession is not enough. There must be a punishment. Tough and fair. And it will definitely be. How many more crimes like these have been committed?” he said.\nIn February, CNNspoke to two former Wagner fighterswho described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges. Deserters, or those who refuse orders are killed and there was no evacuation of the wounded, they said.\nIn January, US Treasury Department designated Wagner Group as asignificant transnational criminal organization, and imposed a slew of fresh sanctions on a transnational network that supports it.\nThe US Department of State concurrently announced a number of sanctions meant to “target a range of Wagner’s key infrastructure – including an aviation firm used by Wagner, a Wagner propaganda organization, and Wagner front companies,” according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

        "headline": "GOP prepared to block vote to replace Feinstein on Senate Judiciary",
        "full_news": "Republicans on Tuesday formally blocked a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee, something Democrats hoped to do in order to advance stalled judicial nominations.\nSenate Democrats are seeking to temporarily replace Feinstein on the powerful panel that processes judicial nominees as the California Democrat remains absent, recovering from shingles.\nSenate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly.\nFeinstein’s return date is still unclear and sheasked just last weekto be “temporarily” replaced on the committee as she recovers.\nSchumer introduced his motion on Tuesday by talking about his friendship with Feinstein, and highlighting her accomplishments.\n“Today, I am acting not just as Leader but as Dianne’s friend, in honoring her wishes, until she returns to the Senate,” Schumer said.\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, objected to Schumer’s request, though he also praised the California Democrat. He argued that Schumer’s move is to get more judges confirmed.\n“She’s a dear friend and we hope for her speedy recovery and return back to the Senate. With all due respect, my colleague, Senator Schumer, this is about a handful of judges that you can’t get the votes for,” Graham said.\nDemocrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and it’s unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success.\nFeinstein, who has already announced she’s not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington “by the end of the March work period,” but that her return got “delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.”\nShe recently said she plans to return “as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel.”\nCardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein.\nThe Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since she’s been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns.\n“I recognize the importance of the numbers on the committee, and this way we can be able to conduct business. I look at this as a way of dealing with a current situation,” Cardin said.\nDemocratswould need 60 votes to replace Feinsteinon the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Feinstein does not return soon, at least 12 nominees, or possibly even more, could be stalled.\nIf Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted – both on the committee and on the Senate floor.\nAsked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she can’t return by May, Schumer responded that he’s “hopeful” she will return “very soon.”\n“Look, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon,” Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol.\nFeinstein announced in February that shewould not run for reelection,and a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary.\nMany congressional Democrats have remained largely supportive of her decision to remain in office while absent from the Capitol as she recovers from shingles.\nBut Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats – and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow.\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbinrecently acknowledged to CNNthat Feinstein’s absence had slowed down the party’s push to confirm nominees. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that “the rain can fall on both sides of the road.”\nAsked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, “Yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time.\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn, a senior member on the Judiciary Committee and close adviser to McConnell, told CNN that he opposes the effort to replace Feinstein on the panel.\n“I don’t think Republicans can or should help President Biden’s most controversial nominees,” the Texas Republican said. “I support having Sen. Feinstein come back as soon as she can. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I don’t think you can expect any Republican cooperation.”\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN’s Manu Raju and Alayna Treene contributed.",

        "headline": "Oklahoma governor calls on officials to resign over recording of racist and threatening remarks",
        "full_news": "The governor of Oklahoma is calling on four McCurtain County officials to resign after they allegedly participated in a secretly recorded conversation that included racist remarks about lynching Black people and talking about killing journalists.\nThe McCurtain Gazette-News over the weekend published the audio it said was recorded following a Board of Commissioners meeting on March 6.\nThe paper said the audio of the meeting was legally obtained, but the McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in astatementthat it was illegally recorded and is investigating. The sheriff’s office also said it believes the recording had been altered.\n“I am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain County,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement Sunday. “There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office. I will not stand idly by while this takes place,” the statement said.\nThe governor called for the immediate resignations of McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy, District 2 Commissioner Mark Jennings, sheriff’s investigator Alicia Manning and jail administrator Larry Hendrix. He also said he would ask the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.\nMcCurtain County is in southeastern Oklahoma, about 200 miles from Oklahoma City.\nThe recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriff’s office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported.\nIn the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspaper’s office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, theOklahomanreported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News.\nAccording to the Oklahoman report, Jennings said, “Oh, you’re talking about you can’t control yourself?” and Manning replied: “Yeah, I ain’t worried about what he’s gonna do to me. I’m worried about what I might do to him. My papaw would have whipped his a**, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper … if my daddy hadn’t been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.”\nJennings replied that his father was once upset by something the newspaper published and “started to go down there and just kill him,” according to the Gazette-News.\nRelated articleLos Angeles police are investigating whether the audio of racist comments made by city officials was recorded illegally\n“I know where two big, deep holes are here if you ever need them,” Jennings allegedly said. Clardy, the sheriff, allegedly said he had the equipment.\n“I’ve got an excavator,” Clardy is accused of saying during the discussion. “Well, these are already pre-dug,” Jennings allegedly said.\nIn other parts of the recording, officials expressed disappointment that Black people could no longer be lynched, according to the paper.\nCNN has not been able to verify the authenticity of the recording or confirm who said what. CNN has reached out to all four county officials for comment.\nThe Oklahoma Sheriffs’ Association voted Tuesday to suspend the membership of Clardy, Manning and Hendrix, the group’s executive director told CNN.\nWillingham and his father, Bruce Willingham, the paper’s publisher, have been advised to temporarily leave town,CNN affiliate KJRHreported.\n“For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,” Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement.\nThe McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in astatementMonday that there is an “ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations” of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it “illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties.” It also said the recording has yet to be “duly authenticated or validated.”\n“Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered. The motivation for doing so remains unclear at this point. That matter is actively being investigated,” the statement said.\nThe Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office has received an audio recording and is investigating, Communications Director Phil Bacharach said.\nThe FBI wouldn’t confirm or deny whether it was involved in the investigation, with spokesperson Kayla McCleery saying it is agency policy not to comment.\nCNN’s Justin Gamble and Christine Sever contributed to this report.",

        "full_news": "The US has sensitive nuclear technology at anuclear power plantinside Ukraine and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month.\nIn the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.”\nGoods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests.\nThe Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. The plant has frequently been disconnected from Ukraine’s power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.\nWhile the plant is still physically operated by Ukrainian staff, Rosatom manages it. The Energy Department warned Rosatom in the letter that it is “unlawful” for any Russian citizens or entities to handle the US technology.\nCNN has reached out to Rosatom for comment.\n“It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.”\nIt is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. The Energy Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration told CNN in a statement that the letter is authentic.\nThe letters were first reported by the news outlet RBC Ukraine.\n“The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\nShe added: “The Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorizing the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.”\nAnother letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.”\nThe Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misattributed the news outlet that first reported the letters. It was RBC Ukraine.",

        "headline": "FDA clears the way for additional bivalent boosters for certain vulnerable individuals",
        "full_news": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administrationamendedthe terms of its emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines on Tuesday, allowing people ages 65 and older and certain people with weakened immunity to get additional doses before this fall’s vaccination campaigns.\nThe bivalent vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna carry instructions for fighting both the original strain of the Covid-19 virus as well as Omicron and its spinoffs.\nThey have been available in the United Statessince Septemberunder emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, which tightly restrict how the vaccines may be given.\nOn Tuesday, the FDA changed the terms of the authorizations for those vaccines so that certain individuals could get an additional dose ahead of most others.\nRelated articleWHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low risk\nNamely, adults ages 65 and older who have received a single dose of a bivalent vaccine may receive an additional dose at least four months following their first dose.\nMost individuals with certain degrees of immunocompromise who have received a first dose of a bivalent vaccine can get a second at least 2 months later.  Additional doses may be administered at the discretion of their healthcare provider.\nDr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, has been calling on the FDA to increase access to the bivalent boosters for those who want them.  He says for the most part, today’s guidance from the agency makes sense.\n“My only question is why the 65 year age cutoff? What was that based on? Ordinarily I would have preferred that it be brought down to 60 or even 50,” Hotez said in an email to CNN.\n“For those Americans who understand its importance, we should make second bivalent boosters available. Finally, we’ll soon need guidance about another annual fall booster. Presumably that information comes sometime this summer,” he added.\nFor immunocompromised children ages 6 months through 4 years, eligibility for additional bivalent doses will depend on the vaccine previously received, the FDA said in a news release.\nAnother big change is that most unvaccinated individuals may now receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine, rather than mutiple doses of the original single-strain vaccines, the agency said.  The FDA simplified its recommendation for unvaccinated individuals after recognizing that most Americans now have some immunity against Covid-19, even if its just through past infections.\n“Evidence is now available that most of the U.S. population 5 years of age and older has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, either from vaccination or infection that can serve as a foundation for the protection provided by the bivalent vaccines. COVID-19 continues to be a very real risk for many people, and we encourage individuals to consider staying current with vaccination, including with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. The available data continue to demonstrate that vaccines prevent the most serious outcomes of COVID-19, which are severe illness, hospitalization, and death,” said Dr. Peter Marks, head of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in anews release.\nRelated articleCelebrities may have helped shape anti-vaccine opinions during Covid-19 pandemic, study finds\nChildren ages 6 months through 5 years who have not yet been vaccinated may now receive a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine as their primary series, or a three-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine if they are 6 months through 4 years of age.  Children who are age 5 may receive two doses of the Moderna bivalent or a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine.\nChildren ages 6 months through 5 years who got started on their monovalent vaccines, can now get a dose of a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses they qualify for will depend on the number of doses they’ve already had and what kind of vaccine they got.\nThe agency stressed that most people who have gotten one dose of a bivalent vaccine are not currently eligible for a second dose.\nAnd they encouraged everyone who hasn’t yet gotten their first dose of a bivalent vaccine to do so, and many Americans are still in that bucket.\nOnly about 17% of those eligible, less than 1 in 5 Americans, has gotten a recommended dose.\nAs time has passed, adults with reduced immune function because of their age or an underlying health problem have been asking doctors whether they need another dose of the bivalent vaccines.\nThe United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane.\nBut the agency has not been free to make what’s known as a “permissive use” recommendation about the boosters, which would allow doctors to offer additional doses to vulnerable patients because of the terms of the EUA.\nThe updated terms give the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) greater freedom to recommend additional doses of the bivalent vaccines. The ACIP is holding a meeting on the Covid-19 vaccines Wednesday and is expected to endorse the FDA’s changes.\nFor everyone not covered by today’s changes, the FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.\nBothCanadaand theUnited Kingdomhave offered another round of bivalent boosters to those at highest risk from Covid-19 this spring.",

        "full_news": "A 34-year-old man was arrested Tuesday evening in connection with the killings of four people who were found dead earlier in the day at a Bowdoin, Maine, home, authorities said.\nThe killings appeared to be connected to a series of nearby highway shootings that left three drivers injured – including one critically – shortly after the four bodies were discovered, state police have said.\nThe man arrested was identified by Maine State Police as Joseph Eaton.\nEaton was taken to Two Bridges Regional Jail and will make an initial court appearance later in the week, state police said in a Tuesday evening news release. State police did not say as of late Tuesday night that he was being held in connection with the highway shootings.\nCNN has not yet been able to identify an attorney for Eaton.\n“Investigators will be working throughout the night processing multiple scenes and continuing to interview people involved with this incident,” state police said in the news release.\nIna statementon Twitter, Maine Gov. Janet Mills said, “Like people across Maine, I am shocked and deeply saddened – acts of violence like we experienced today shake our state and our communities to the core.”\nMaine State Police responded Tuesday morning to the Bowdoin home, where they found the four deceased victims inside, state police Lt. Randall Keaten said in a news conference earlier Tuesday.\nShortly after, authorities received reports of several vehicles getting hit by gunfire on I-295 in the area of Yarmouth, which is about 40 minutes from Bowdoin.\nThree people were shot while driving and were taken to the hospital, state police said. At least one of those three was in critical condition Tuesday, authorities added.\n“We’ve got vehicles that have been hit by straight gunfire all across that we’re getting reports on, so if anybody has holes in their vehicles, please contact us so that we can follow up with that,” Keaten said.\nThe victims found in the Bowdoin home and the highway shootings are connected, Keaten said, adding there is no threat to the public.\nThe four bodies were taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Augusta where autopsies will determine the manner and cause of death state police said.\nAuthorities have asked anyone who may have witnessed something or has any information about the Tuesday morning incidents to reach out.\n“A lot happened this morning between those two scenes and those are the people that we want to talk to, those people that were impacted by this,” Keaten said, adding authorities were continuing to work on several impacted scenes and gather more information.\nCNN’s Sara Smart and Laura James contributed to this report.",

        "full_news": "Hundreds of Southwest Airlines flights were delayed after technical issues that prompted the airline to temporarily halt its operations on Tuesday morning.\nSouthwest said the flight delays were the result of “data connection issues resulting from a firewall failure,” a problem that led to a brief ground stop.\n“Early this morning, a vendor-supplied firewall went down and connection to some operational data was unexpectedly lost,” spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement.\nRelated articleWhat should I do if my flight has been canceled or delayed?\nSouthwest had delayed 1,820 flights or 43% of its schedule as of just after noon Tuesday, according to FlightAware. The airline has canceled only nine flights on Tuesday, according to FlightAware. Southwest says its workers “worked quickly to minimize disruptions.”\nSouthwest reported technology issues Tuesday morning and said it would “hopefully be resuming our operation as soon as possible.”\nThe FAA in a statement told CNN that Southwest “requested the FAA pause the airline’s departures.”\nThe problems come months after the airline was forced to cancel more than 16,700 flights between December 20 and 29, roughly half its schedule during that period. Theairline attributed the meltdown in partto changes to its staff scheduling computer systems. Southwest last monthunveiled an “action plan”to prevent another operational meltdown.\nSouthwest called the latest problem “intermittent technology issues” in a social media post to customers. Several took to social media to complain about delayed flights.\n“We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we’re hoping to get everyone going ASAP,” the airline wrote in another social media post.\nA massive winter stormstarted the service problems during the holiday season,but Southwest had a much tougher time recovering because of an antiquated crew scheduling system that was quickly overwhelmed, leaving the airline unable to get the staffing it needed to locations to operate flights. Nearly half of its schedule was canceled during from December 20 to December 29. Some days, as many as 75% of its scheduled flights were grounded.\nPart of what created worse problems at Southwest than at other airlines is that crew members had to call in to the airline, rather than notify it electronically, to let them it of their availability.",

        "full_news": "Buffalo Bills safetyDamar Hamlin, who has been cleared to resume football activities, said Tuesday his cardiac arrest during an NFL game in January was caused bycommotio cordis.\nHamlin went intocardiac arrestafter making a tackle and appearing to be hit with a helmet in his chest during the first quarter of the Bills’ game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.\nCommotio cordis can occur when severe trauma to the chest disrupts the heart’s electrical charge and causes dangerous fibrillations.\n“I died on national TV in front of the whole world,”Hamlin said in his first sessionwith reporters since the injury. “I lost a bunch of people in my life. I know a bunch of people who lost people in their lives. I know that feeling. That right there is the biggest blessing of it all – for me to still have my people and my people to still have me.”\nThe 25-year-old has been at the Bills’ practice facility in Orchard Park, New York, participating in voluntary offseason workouts this week, according to the team.\n“He is fully cleared,” Bills General Manager Brandon Beane told reporters. “He’s here.”\nHamlin said he was blessed to have a wonderful medical staff who “treat me with the care of their children.”\nThe safety said his heart is still in the game and he was announcing his comeback to the NFL.\n“I just want to show people that fear is a choice. You can keep going at something without having the answers and without knowing what’s at the end of the tunnel,” he said. “You might feel anxious – you might feel any type of way – but you just keep putting that right foot in front of the left one and you keep going. I want to stand for that.”\n“(Hamlin’s) in a great headspace to come back and make his return,” Beane added.\nBills head coach Sean McDermott said the team is happy that Hamlin is back.\n“We’re super excited for Damar. He’s moving forward one step at a time here. He’s been cleared from a physical standpoint,” McDermott said.\n“We’ll provide all of the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint so just happy for him that he’s been able to check some of those boxes to this point and we’re moving forward taking it one day at a time.”\nHamlin likely went through a lot of tests, including electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, before doctors cleared him to return to training.\n“What it basically means a few things. One is that his heart function returned to normal. He has no underlying problems with the anatomy of the heart itself, and he has no underlying electrical problems, so that’s the most important thing –  and the way they figured that out over the last three-and-a-half months was to do a lot of tests,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on “CNN News Central.”",

        "full_news": "The top US Navy admiral ardently defended a non-binary sailor on Tuesday amid some criticism from Republican lawmakers, saying he is “particularly proud of this sailor.”\nBut Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday defended the sailor, emphasizing that it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a warfighting team.\n“I’ll tell you why I’m particularly proud of this sailor,” Gilday told the hearing. “So, her grandfather served during World War II, and he was gay and he was ostracized in the very institution that she not only joined and is proud to be a part of, but she volunteered to deploy on Ford and she’ll likely deploy again next month when Ford goes back to sea.”\nGilday used female pronouns to refer to Knutson but the Navy told CNN Knutson’s pronouns of choice are non-binary.\n“We ask people from all over the country, from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds to join us,” Gilday said, “and then it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a cohesive warfighting team that’s going to follow the law, and the law requires that we be able to conduct prompt, sustained operations at sea. That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so … if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I’m proud to serve beside them.”\nSome Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have attacked the military for being too “woke,” claiming it has been one of the causes of the military’s poor recruiting numbers, despite a recent Army survey showing only 5% of potential recruits were concerned about “wokeness.”\nLast month, Republican Rep. Cory Mills and several others went after the Defense Department on its diversity, equity and inclusion training at a House Armed Services Subcommittee hearing on military personnel. Mills said, “We absolutely 150% can out-pronoun every single one of our adversaries, and China and Russia I’m sure are quaking in their boots over this.”\nIn response, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros said diversity and equal opportunity training have been a part of the military for decades.\nAt another hearing in early-March with the military’s top enlisted leaders, Sgt. Maj. Of the Army Michael Grinston stressed that the military’s focus remains on combat lethality, even with additional training on diversity and inclusion.\n“There is one hour of equal opportunity training in basic training, and 92 hours of rifle marksmanship training,” Grinston said at the time. “And if you go to [One Station Unit Training], there is 165 hours of rifle marksmanship training and still only one hour of equal opportunity training.”",

        "full_news": "The Fulton County District Attorney’s office said some fake electors for Donald Trump have implicated each other in potential criminal activity and is seeking to disqualify their lawyer,according to a new court filing.\nThe district attorney’s office is requesting that attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow be disqualified from representing a group of 10 Republicans who served as electors for the former president in Georgia – a state Trump lost to President Joe Biden. The DA’s office also accused the lawyer of failing to present an immunity deal to her clients last year, according to the filing.\nThe new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were “imminent.”\nRelated articleGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp urges Republicans to move on from election fraud claims: '2020 is ancient history'\nIt notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.\n“The statement of some of her clients that directly implicate another client in additional crimes shows that Ms. Debrow’s continued participation in this matter is fraught with conflicts of interest that rise to the level of her being disqualified from this case in its entirety,” the district attorney’s office wrote in the filing.\nDuring the April 2023 interviews, “some of the electors stated that another elector represented by Ms. Debrow committed acts that are violations of Georgia law and that they were not party to these additional acts,” according to the filing.\nAmid a fight last year to compel the fake electors to testify, the court instructed two attorneys, including Debrow, to inform their clients with potential immunity deals. The attorneys told the court that they spoke to their clients and none of the clients were interested, according to filing. Now the DA’s office is claiming those offers were never presented to the clients.\n“Additionally, in these interviews, some of the electors represented by Ms. Debrow told members of the investigation team that no potential offer of immunity was ever brought to them in 2022,” the filing states.\nDebrow slammed the latest motion in a statement.\n“The DA’s Motion is baseless, false, and offensive,” Debrow said. “None of my clients have committed any crimes, and they necessarily have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes.”\nNo one has been charged yet in the Georgia case, though several people – including the 16 fake electors and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – were informed they were potential targets of Willis’s probe.\nA special grand jury investigating the matter concluded its work late last year and recommended more than a dozen people should face charges, the foreperson for the panel said in interviews.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

        "headline": "High speed trains are racing across the world. But not in America",
        "full_news": "High speed trains have proved their worth across the world over the past 50 years.\nIt’s not just in reducing journey times, but more importantly, it’s in driving economic growth, creating jobs and bringing communities closer together. China, Japan and Europe lead the way.\nSo why doesn’t the United States have a high-speed rail network like those?\nFor the richest and most economically successful nation on the planet, with an increasingly urbanized population of more than 300 million, it’s a position that is becoming more difficult to justify.\nAlthough Japan started the trend with itsShinkansen “Bullet Trains” in 1964, it was the advent of France’s TGV in the early 1980s that really kick-started a global high-speed train revolution that continues to gather pace.\nRelated articleNew trains and new rail routes to experience in Japan\nBut it’s a revolution that has so far bypassed the United States. Americans are still almost entirely reliant on congested highways or the headache-inducing stress of an airport and airline network prone to meltdowns.\nChina has built around 26,000 miles (42,000 kilometers) of dedicated high-speed railways since 2008 and plans to top 43,000 miles (70,000 kilometers) by 2035.\nMeanwhile, the United States has just 375 route-miles of track cleared foroperation at more than 100 mph.\n“Many Americans have no concept of high-speed rail and fail to see its value. They are hopelessly stuck with a highway and airline mindset,” says William C. Vantuono, editor-in-chief of Railway Age, North America’s oldest railroad industry publication.\nCars and airliners have dominated long-distance travel in the United States since the 1950s, rapidly usurping a network of luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such as “The Empire Builder,” “Super Chief” and “Silver Comet.”\nDeserted by Hollywood movie stars and business travelers, famous railroads such as the New York Central were largely bankrupt by the early 1970s, handing over their loss-makingtrains to Amtrak, the national passenger train operator founded in 1971.\nIn the decades since that traumatic retrenchment, US freight railroads have largely flourished. Passenger rail seems to have been a very low priority for US lawmakers.\nPowerful airline, oil and auto industry lobbies in Washington have spent millions maintaining that superiority, but their position is weakening in the face of environmental concerns and worsening congestion.\nUSPresident Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure billincludes an unprecedented $170 billion for improving railroads.\nSome of this will be invested in repairing Amtrak’s crumbling Northeast Corridor (NEC) linking Boston, New York and Washington.\nThere are also big plans to bring passenger trains back to many more cities across the nation – providing fast, sustainable travel to cities and regions that have not seen a passenger train for decades.\nAdd to this the success of the privately funded Brightline operation in Florida, which has been given the green light to build a $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas by 2027, plus schemes in California, Texas and the proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle and Vancouver, and the United States at last appears to be on the cusp of a passenger rail revolution.\nRelated articleSpain's high-speed railway revolution\n“Every president since Ronald Reagan has talked about the pressing need to improve infrastructure across the USA, but they’ve always had other, bigger priorities to deal with,” says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer of train builder Alstom’s US division.\n“But now there’s a huge impetus to get things moving – it’s a time of optimism. If we build it, they will come. As an industry, we’re maturing, and we’re ready to take the next step. It’s time to focus on passenger rail.”\nSherin points out that other public services such as highways and airports are “massively subsidized,” so there shouldn’t be an issue with doing the same for rail.\n“We need to do a better job of articulating the benefits of high-speed rail – high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines – and that will help us to build bipartisan support,” he adds. “High-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.”\nOnly Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor has trains that can travel at speeds approaching those of the 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph) TGV and Shinkansen.\nThis year, Amtrak plans to introduce its new generation Avelia Liberty trains to replace the life-expired Acelas on the NEC.\nCapable of reaching 220 mph (although they’ll be limited to 160 mph on the NEC), the trains will bring Alstom’s latest high-speed rail technology to North America.\nThe locomotives at each end – known as power cars – are close relatives of the next generationTGV-M trains, scheduled to debut in France in 2024.\nSitting between the power cars are the passenger vehicles, which use Alstom’s Tiltronix technology to run faster through curves by tilting their bodies, much like a MotoGP rider does. And it’s not just travelers who will benefit.\n“When Amtrak awarded the contract to Alstom in 2015 to 2016, the company had around 200 employees in Hornell,” says Shawn D. Hogan, former mayor of the city of Hornell in New York state.\n“That figure is now nearer 900, with hiring continuing at a fast pace. I calculate that there has been a total public/private investment of more than $269 million in our city since 2016, including a new hotel, a state-of-the-art hospital and housing developments.\n“It is a transformative economic development project that is basically unheard of in rural America and if it can happen here, it can happen throughout the United States.”\nAlstom has spent almost $600 million on building a US supply chain for its high-speed trains – more than 80% of the train is made in the United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states.\n“High-speed rail is already here. Avelia Liberty was designed jointly with our European colleagues, so we have what we need for ‘TGV-USA’,” adds Sherin.\n“It’s all proven tech from existing trains. We’re ready to go when the infrastructure arrives.”\nAnd those new lines could arrive sooner than you might think.\nRelated articleTaiwan's extraordinary 111-year-old forest railway gets a makeover\nIn March, Brightline confirmed plans to begin construction on a 218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, carving a path through the San Bernardino Mountains and across the desert, following the Interstate 15 corridor.\nThe 200 mph line will slash times to little more than one hour – a massive advantage over the four-hour average by car or five to seven hours by bus – when it opens in 2027.\nBrightline West expects to inject around $10 billion worth of benefits into the region’s economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs, as well as 1,000 permanent jobs in maintenance, operations and customer service in Southern California and Nevada.\nIt will also mark the return of passenger trains to Las Vegas after a 30-year hiatus – Amtrak canceled its “Desert Wind” route in 1997.\nBrightline hopes to attract around12 million of the 50 million one-way tripstaken annually between Las Vegas and LA, 85% of which are taken by bus or car.\nMeanwhile, construction is progressing on another high-speed line through the San Joaquin Valley.\nSet to open around 2030, California High Speed Rail (CHSR) will run from Merced to Bakersfield (171 miles) at speeds of up to 220 mph.\nCoupled with proposed upgrades to commuter rail lines at either end, this project could eventually allow high-speed trains to run the 350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles to San Francisco metropolitan areas in just two hours and 40 minutes.\nCHSR has been on the table as far back as 1996, but its implementation has been controversial.\nDisagreements over the route, management issues, delays in land acquisition and construction, cost over-runs and inadequate funding for completing the entire system have plagued the project – despite the economic benefits it will deliver as well as reducing pollution and congestion. Around 10,000 people are already employed on the project.\nCosting $63 billion to $98 billion, depending on the final extent of the scheme, CHSR is to connect six of the 10 largest cities in the state and provide the same capacity as 4,200 miles of new highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates and two new airport runways costing between $122 billion and $199 billion.\nWith California’s population expected to grow to more than 45 million by 2050, high-speed rail offers the best value solution to keep the state from grinding to a smoggy halt.\nBrightline West and CHSR offer templates for the future expansion of high-speed rail in North America.\nBy focusing on pairs of cities or regions that are too close for air travel and too far apart for car drivers, transportation planners can predict which corridors offer the greatest potential.\n“It’s logical that the US hasn’t yet developed a nationwide high-speed network,” says Sherin. “For decades, traveling by car wasn’t a hardship, but as highway congestion gets worse, we’ve reached a stage where we should start looking more seriously at the alternatives.\n“The magic numbers are centers of population with around three million people that are 200 to 500 miles apart, giving a trip time of less than three hours – preferably two hours.\nRelated articleHow one European country is planning a 'rail revolution'\nSherin points to the success of the original generation of Acela trains as evidence of this.\n“When the first generation Acela trains started running between New York City and Washington in 2000, Amtrak attracted so many travelers that the airlines stopped running their frequent ‘shuttles’ between the two cities,” he adds.\nHowever, industry observer Vantuono is more pessimistic.\n“A US high-speed rail network is a pipe dream,” he says. “A lack of political support and federal financial support combined with the kind of fierce landowner opposition that CHSR has faced in California means that the challenges for new high-speed projects are enormous.”\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), urban and high-speed rail hold “major promise to unlock substantial benefits” in reducing global transport emissions.\nDr. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, argues that rail transport is “often neglected” in public debates about future transport systems – and this is especially true in North America.\n“Despite the advent of cars and airplanes, rail of all types has continued to evolve and thrive,” adds Birol.\nGlobally, around three-quarters of rail passenger movements are made on electric-powered vehicles, putting the mode in a unique position to take advantage of the rise in renewable energy over the coming decades.\nHere, too, the United States lags far behind the rest of the world, with electrification almost unheard of away from the NEC.\nIn North America, on the other hand, less than 5% of rail routes are electrified.\nThe enormous size of the United States and its widely dispersed population mitigates against the creation of a single, unified network of the type being built in China andproposed for Europe.\nAir travel is likely to remain the preferred option for transcontinental journeys that can be more than 3,000 miles (around 4,828 kilometers).\nBut there are many shorter inter-city travel corridors where high-speed rail, or a combination of new infrastructure and upgraded railroad tracks or tilting trains, could eventually provide an unbeatable alternative to air travel and highways.",

        "full_news": "Second Strike Update, Snowstorm Chaos, Dell Donation Pledge and more\nCNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip\nThe Source with Kaitlan Collins\nThe Assignment with Audie Cornish\nEvery Thursday on The Assignment, host Audie Cornish explores the animating forces of this extraordinary American political moment. It’s not about the horse race, it’s about the larger cultural ideas driving the conversation: the role of online influencers on the electorate, the intersection of pop culture and politics, and discussions with primary voices and thinkers who are shaping the political conversation.\nThe Assignment with Audie Cornish\nCan Country music help lead the U.S. out of the gun debate? There is a long history of famous country musicians using their platforms to comment on social and political issues. But since the lead singer of The Chicks, Natalie Maines, was ostracized after criticizing then President George W. Bush, country music stars have felt safer keeping their political views out of the public eye. Musician\nis trying to change that. After the shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, Ketch wrote an\ncalling for country music stars to let go of the fear of retaliation from their fanbase, and to break their silence on the gun debate. Audie talks with Ketch about what it’s like to be a musician and a parent in Nashville right now and what he thinks country musicians can do to help prevent another mass shooting.\nI didn't think we'd be doing another episode about a mass shooting so soon. But here we are.\nThis is from a vigil in Nashville.\nThank you to our artists for sharing the gift of music. You are the custodians of that special gift.\nI've been to this place, and I don't mean some kind of memorial after a mass shooting, but Nashville specifically. I lived there for a few years covering the South, and it's not a big city. It's dominant industries of music and publishing can make it feel even smaller, like everyone knows everyone. So when First Lady Jill Biden visited the city to attend a vigil for the shooting victims of the Covenant School, it was an absolute given that a country music artist would be there.\nThis is Ketch Secor, founding member of the Grammy Award winning band Old Crow Medicine Show. I didn't even get an introduction at the vigil, but that's because everyone in the crowd already knows who he is, not just a famous musician, but a member of their community and a parent of two school aged kids. In fact, the school his kids attend in East Nashville, he co-founded it in 2016. It's called the Episcopal School of Nashville.\nSo I'm wearing two different hats here when a school shooting happens in our town. It's both as a parent and it's as somebody who's on the other side of the pick up line as well. When a country singer gets off the road, chances are at 8:00 in the morning on Monday after the big weekend, that guy or gal is in line dropping their kid off at a school in Nashville, Tennessee. When it comes to your home, it's different.\nAnd the sky lowered in the sky.\nKetch Secor recently wrote an op ed for The New York Times that caught our attention. It was titled Country Music Can Lead America Out of its Obsession with Guns. In it, he calls for country musicians to speak candidly to their audiences about gun culture. I wanted to have him on the show to talk about that op ed, like, can country music really help lead the U.S. out of a gun debate? And what are the stakes for a musician in the genre if they actually take a stand? And what's it like to live at the center of it all as a parent, educator and musician in Nashville, Tennessee? This is the assignment. I'm Audie Cornish.\nThe shooting at the Covenant School kind of prompted you to write an op ed for The New York Times. But can you take me back to that day a little bit? Where were you when you heard it happening?\nSure it was on Monday, two weeks ago, and it was at 10:13 in the morning. I got a text message from our school attorney saying, I'm so sorry, and I had no idea what was going on. And prayer hand emoji is interesting.\nSo getting an emoji like that or getting the obligatory \"are you okay\" that we all start to send each other now when there's a shooting, especially at a school, you're saying it it hits you in a place of what? Panic. Fear. What? What do you feel?\nIt's. It's all the above. It's. It's your kids. It's someone else's kids. You know, the head of school was murdered. The connections between our school are very present, and it's as a community member in Nashville, this shocking realization. Oh, this thing that happens in other towns has come to our town. And it's come not just to our town, but to our children, to our the place that is most sacred.\nAnd even to your corner of that world, Right? Like it didn't happen at a public school. It didn't happen at a big university. It happened at essentially a small Christian primary school. Right. Which is what you what you founded one, right? It had connections.\nYeah. And our schools are very different in that regard and serve different populations. However, it you know, we're all the same. We are all every school, public, private, charter, every stripe is in the business of believing that kids are our future and must be stewarded and loved on and guided. And, you know, that's a real elemental principle for me.\nCan I ask, how old are your kids and do they go to the school you founded?\nYeah, they do. And they're nine and 11.\nSo did the school you founded this Episcopal school, did it go into lockdown? Kind of what what did you you all have to do as a result?\nNo, the schools adjacent to Covenant did, but the others in Nashville did not. And so the thing I think that was so sad that first day was the message that went out saying your children have not yet been notified. The staff knows, the teachers know, everybody knows, all the parents know, everybody knows but the kids. And we're going to talk about it tomorrow. But we wanted to give you the chance to talk about it first. So if you can imagine a pick up line, anybody who's who's been through a school shooting in their community knows, you know, the pick up line that first day is full of tears.\nRight. And for people who aren't familiar with how big ups and drop offs work these days in schools, there is a line right, where like there are kind of they are chaperoning your kid the literally to the curb and you pick them up. There's not just like wandering out of the building where I think if you were a kid in the nineties is what you grew up with. Yeah, it's hand to hand pass off.\nThat's right, Audie. You must have kids.\nWell, the juxtaposition of kids full of vibrant joy and life and parents full of grief and sadness coming together. This meeting to me was very powerful.\nMeaning you're standing on the curb waiting to get your kid. But every parent's face is just drawn.\nAnd every parent is looking at every teacher and just, you know, holding back tears as is every teacher. But every child continues to feel very safe. And yet we all know as parents that no child is safe any longer because this tragedy is in our backyard. It's come to Nashville, it's come to us, to our kids.\nI guess I want to start maybe with Wagon Wheel, because if people go to look you up, that might be the first song they learn about. And you even write about it in this op ed. Tell me a little bit about where you were in your career when you wrote this.\nSure. Well, Wagon Wheel is my most successful song.\nHeaded down South to the Land of the Pines. I'm coming my way to North Carolina, staring up.\nAnd it's a collaboration with Bob Dylan. I wrote it when I was about 17, going to school up in New England in a prep school called Exeter, and I was had just learned to play the banjo up there.\nSo rock me mama like a wagon wheel. Rock me mama, any way you feel. Hey mama rock me\nYou talk about the idea that your best known song, Wagon Wheel, is often blasting out of a truck, so to speak, that has an NRA sticker. And you mention this specifically, and I want you to talk about why.\nWhen you make the kind of music that I make with a fiddle and a banjo and harmony singing and a particular style of songwriting, you're engaging in a community that might be different than your own sort of background, and it's not. Well, there's a train going by right now. This is sort of evidence..\nThe trains are always going by in Nashville.\nJust got to keep it going on the podcast. It'll add a little bit of color and speaks to what I'm talking about. You know, the trains are going by. The trucks have NRA stickers. You know, when I was a kid, there were Confederate flags everywhere. This is The South, y'all. It's different than the other parts of the country now, for better or for worse. But it is what it is.\nAnd when you're around Nashville and you have political conversations, wherever the person falls on the spectrum, inevitably someone uses that phrase, Well, this is The South.\nLike, that's supposed to cover a lot of things.\nYeah. And whether it's supposed to be that way or, you know, I think we're in a state of considerable growth down south, but the vestiges remain, and they're important to talk about in this regard, because one of the vestiges is gun culture, and it's largely considered like the rebel flag in the past, just something that exists here. Deal with it, y'all. When in fact, we have always had the power to drop the rebel flag. There's one vestige that has been challenged effectively.\nAnd effected change in one way, or at least raise the kind of societal stakes engaging in certain language.\nTotally. And so I see the change in gun culture is just like another step towards The South's evolution.\nTo my mind, country, Americana, these genres so closely align with their audiences. It's very much like hip-hop, like people in hip-hop talk about the culture and their ties to the music, and the music ties to quite literally the identity of the people listening. And country feels very much the same way. But as a result, it has a lot of like rules. You know, there's a couple lines you they people don't like you to step out of. Can you talk about how that plays out in modern country?\nSure. Well, today's country singer might not come from The South and is college educated. So that they're in has already changed the stereotype of who sings country music. You know, it's it's not coal miners anymore. The coal miner's daughter like we all love Loretta, but that's not who's on number one right now. So that part of it has changed a lot. But what hasn't changed so much are the attitudes of the audience.\nWhich to be clear. The country music audience also is wealthier and are decision makers and our often managers, there's been sort of like a lot of research into many people who are in the audience, and the audience probably looks a little different than people expect as well.\nWell, I didn't know to go into this, but but I'm excited that we are, Audie, because, you know, country music really especially, and to clarify, contemporary country music on the radio is a real safe space for us to not talk about political divisiveness and not talk about things of of substance. But instead we're all sort of reading the Pulp Fiction together. And it's it's\nWhich is why it's popular, right? I mean, during the pandemic, I heard the growth of listening to the music or streaming maybe was up 15%. It was higher than any other genre.\nPeople welcome that safe space.\nTravel story. It's you know, it's very much stories, intergenerational family tales. That's the kind of stuff that goes number one is the song about grandpa and what a good guy he was and how if we could be a little bit more like him, then the world would be a better place. So this sort of, you know, hallmark kind of these ideals that are tossed around might not be that realistic for today's reality of, you know, I worked I'm part of a global economy working two jobs. And, you know, I'm hoping my kids are going to go get out of state tuition or whatever. And yet we country music really deals in nostalgia. And that nostalgia is a an important antidote to all of the pain that one can witness in the click of a mouse.\nRight. So how does gun. Culture interact with that nostalgia, storytelling, because you're saying in a way that that's built into the music, too.\nJohnny Cash singing I Shot a Man in Reno to Watch Him Die. Hank Jr Singing about. Yeah, I'd like to spit some beach nut in that dude's eye and shoot him with my old 45 because a country boy can survive. This is a way to for country music to retain authority in a changing world. And guns--\nBut do you hear it in the modern music? Are there? You don't have to pick out any artist. But do people still talk about that?\nNo, Audie. And that's the thing. We don't talk about guns. If we do, it's a song about I took my boy hunting for the first time. It's again, dealing in the nostalgia. What it's not saying is I've got an AR-15 in my collection. But the reality is that many, many listeners do. And yet it's a safe space where they are not confronted by the music to a changing reality. Instead, they are allowed to say, I taught my child how to, you know, I mean, when I was a kid in the eighties, like I went bird hunt with Dad, I learned how to fire a weapon. I learned how to clean a weapon. These things are important to the ways that gun culture can be a positive, but the safe space is that we're not talking about what it means in today's America. Instead, we're pretty much hanging in yesterday's.\nSo what is it like for artists such as yourself to raise this issue?\nPeople keep saying, thanks for being brave. And I'm like. You know who's brave is the kid that pulled the fire alarm, you know, in the hallway under gunfire in our town in a school, a kid that was a third grader. Now, that's brave. All I'm doing is just I'm a singer and I'm going to sing about the stuff that's real. I'm a writer, and I'm going to tell what I see.\nI don't want to read too much into the zoom, but I. Are you getting emotional talking about that?\nOh, yeah. I mean, I've been I've been crying for two weeks, ya'll, like it's... When this comes to your town and they bury the same age kid as yours. And then and then, like, while the graves are still fresh, the news cycle moves on to Stormy Daniels, and that's the reality. It's like, Good God, where do we live? What do we not care about kids at all? It's just over. So this is my way of saying it's not over and it won't be over until those deaths, those three deaths of American children gunned down in the third grade, until they mean something, that's when it'll be over.\nMore with Ketch Secor in just a moment.\nYou are demanding a new kind of movement come out of the south. And that it in part be led by people who are cultural figures as well, not just politicians, people such as yourself. Why do you think it could make a difference?\nWell, I think that Nashville stands uniquely poised to lead a response to the school shooting epidemic.\nBut why do you think that? Right? We just watched the Tennessee State House expel two members because they had a protest related to gun policy. Expel, not censure, not reprimand. Try to kick them out. So what what to your mind leads you to think that?\nWell, Nashville, despite the fact that the state legislature is what it is, Nashville is a very progressive city. And I'm not saying that Tennessee is going to lead the way. I'm saying Nashville.\nYeah, but isn't that the tough part? If in all these states and it's not just Tennessee, you've got these blue cities, these little blue dots in a sea of red, and by red I mean very conservative, very pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment legislatures. This sounds like an uphill battle. What you're calling for.\nAnd I know it's worth it. I don't want to because we all know it's worth it. But I want I want to understand why you think country musicians are in any way uniquely positioned to have this conversation.\nWell, and I want to I appreciate you challenging this Audie. First thing I want to say is that changing segregation was an uphill battle in Tennessee. And and when Nashville in the early 1960s, in the late 1950s said its first foot forward, this was the proving ground, other parts of the South were too unsafe. But people gathered in Nashville, a city of colleges, a city of progressive thought in the South to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience. This is where John Lewis came. This is where the Freedom Riders first stop was.\nTheir trainings, right, with James Lawson and at Vanderbilt.\nAll of that training at Fisk and Vanderbilt happened right here in Nashville, Tennessee. That shows our ability as a as a community to exist outside of the state. Now, just like in that time, the state legislator said, what are you talking about? That's not going to happen in our state. We cast the deciding vote on on women's suffrage. I mean, Tennessee has been a bellwether place in these two other instances of great significance. This is the third. This is the part of the death knell of the old South, which is going to have to change. You know, 50 years from now I think we're going to be looking back at these couple of years as the deciding time for a assault weapons ban in the United States.\nAgain, I want to bring it to the question about country music artists, especially mainstream ones who given what we know about the music, number one, have been socially punished for activism by what we call Music Row, by music radio, by country music radio in particular, which still has a very kind of strong grip in a way programmers do, and even recent history. Right. When you think about the Dixie Chicks, etc., their whole story is a story of being ostracized for their activism.\nYou know, for a guy like me, I'm not beholden to too many people at all, but I'm not a mainstream. I'm not on the Jumbotron, you know, I'm not at the awards show with the top ten performers of the year.\nDo you need those people for the movement you're talking about?\nThey have a really far reach and the power to accelerate an inevitable movement to change this for our kids. And I'm asking them through this piece and also face to face in my community, through conversations of text. You know, I've reached out to so many singers in the past two weeks.\nAnd what kind of text you send.\nHey, I'm just reaching out to all my Nashville music community in the wake of the shooting and sharing this story that I wrote that came out today in The Times. If you get a sec, please take a look.\nWhat's been the most positive response? What's been the most frustrating one?\nThe most frustrating one is silence. I say in the op ed piece that I think silence is complicity. I went into the studio and I and I recorded a new song on the subject. Since the shooting, which is only two weeks ago there have been so many ways to be engaged with this terrible story, and it's powerful solution.\nI mean, the reason why I'm asking is because your op ed said something pretty specific, right? That there are artists who are tired at being at the kind of mercy of the whims of fearmongers, you said, and that they're ready to speak to an impressionable audience. And because other genres, like we mentioned hip hop earlier or pop, they do wade into societal issues. They can be confrontational about politics. It's not like there isn't a model out there. So I guess what would it take, do you think, for people in your industry? To start to do something similar, which is which is, in effect, what you're calling for.\nIt is beginning and it's, I think, in its infancy, but it's already started.\nAnd so it's about fanning the flames and building a big bonfire out of what's already crackling kindling. For example, we've got a benefit concert here in Nashville that supports Covenant School. And when you look at the the roster, who's on the marquee, it's not the usual Americana folks who always say, you know, we stand with kids, we stand up against gun violence. Instead, it's number one chart toppers. They are there. They have put their hat into the ring.\nBut is it because it's is it going to be a safe space from politics? If it's a moment of a memorial, is that what makes it okay for a big artist to be there? Right. Because nobody's going to get up and say we should have gun control.\nThere's nothing but up here because we we have started at the very baseline where music coming out of Nashville on the radio says nothing about violence against children in our schools or about the need to rethink the types of weaponry that is associated with the Second Amendment. Kelsea Ballerini talked about it on an award show. These are the kinds of things that when somebody takes one step and the movement can quickly follow it, then the next step isn't as hard to make. And what I'm asking for is that next step. You know, I've gotten a lot of feedback from my audience. And like I say in an op ed piece, you know, I see the NRA sticker on the back of lot of trucks blaring in my tunes. So, you know, and we're out on the road with Hank Jr. this summer. So, I mean, I'm I'm used to playing to an audience that is our country folk. But I love my country folk audience. And I and I want to be able to be real with them. I can move freely in both of the spaces that the two big silos in the country. Like, I might go to work in one silo and come home and the other one. And I'm good with that because I love those people.\nWhat is your message to those artists who are just still very reluctant?\nCountry music has a great destiny in these times to swing out past the fences that have corralled it in so tightly. That I believe in this genre. And I believe that it has the power to carry that truth. You know, it's very much rooted in a gospel tradition of of the lamentation, the calling out to the great spirits. Help us, Lord. We're just your children. We don't know shit. We're we're dying down here. Help!\nCan you talk about the song that you've written out of this moment?\nNew material? You know, generally, just like I'm in a songwriting mood here, I'm in a a moment in time with a lot of different opportunities as a writer to engage on this, whether it's, you know, writing the right caption for a photograph on Instagram or writing an op ed piece for The New York Times or being on this podcast with you, Audie. There's so many ways to choose my words right now and try and have them be resonant for the pain that we're feeling in Nashville, Tennessee and around the country because we are just so tired, parents, that our kids are not safe in their schools. What that means for me as a songwriter is that I also have the chance to write new music about this and to put my money where my mouth is. So I got a new song that's coming out called Louder Than Guns. That's yeah, I just recorded it two days ago.\nGive me a sense of the tune or lyrics.\nWell, gosh, I feel like I shouldn't even brought it up because it's so...anytime you get a you know, people are cagey about their new stuff!\nYou're dealing with a dude that wept through the whole songwriting process. Let me sing it for you.\nAll right.  woke up this morning. It was Groundhog Day. I saw the same black veil on a crying face and a flag flying half way. This time it was people I know gunned down in a minute or so. Only God knows when it'll stop. But thoughts and prayers ain't enough. Louder than guns. More powerful than bullets flying. Is the voice rising up saying it's about time to put the last nail in the coffin, put the last body in the ground, calling on every town, shout. Louder than guns There's a law on a dusty scroll.\nKetch Secor is the father of two kids in Nashville, Tennessee.

No, I don't want to hear another rat a tat tat tat echoed down the hallway. Freedom's just another word for letting every voice be heard, every heart, every hand. Every town take a stand. Louder than guns. More powerful than bullets flying. Is the voice rising up, saying it's about damn time. We put the last nail in the coffin. We put the last body in the ground.

(It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.)\nWhether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gonemuch more smoothlythan the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic.\n“This is the first tax season since 2019 where the IRS and the nation were on normal footing,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a call with reporters.\nFor instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some newfundingafter years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And the wait times on those phone calls dropped to just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.\nThe agency also added a roster of new online tools for filers, he added.\nThose online tools may be especially helpful today if you are scrambling to get your return in before midnight. Or, if you’ve come to the realization that you need to file for an extension. Either way, here are some key things to know:\nNot everyone has to file on April 18:If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you.Hereis where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\nThanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.\nIf you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone.This IRS publicationoffers more detail.\nRelated articleTaxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time\nLastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as theEarned Income Tax Credit. (Usethis IRS toolto gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to useIRS Free File(intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.\nYour paycheck may not be your only source of income:If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.\nOther potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:\nOrganize your tax documents:By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).\nIf you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.\nHere are some of the tax forms you may have received:\n“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.\nOne very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill:If you’re eligible to make atax-deductible contribution to an IRAand haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.\nProofread your return before submitting it:Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with aprofessional tax preparer.\nLittle mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance ofyour refundif you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\nWhat to do if you can’t file by April 18:If you’re not able to file on time, fill outForm 4868electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\nRelated articleYour tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and apenaltyon any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today.\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\nOr the more efficient route ispay what you owe electronicallyat IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.\nIf you opt to electronicallypay directlyfrom your bank account, which is free,select “extension”and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.\nYou can also pay by credit or debit card,but you will be charged aprocessing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\nIf you can’t pay what you owe in full, the IRS does have somepayment plan options. But it might be smart to first consult with a certified public accountant or a tax preparer who is an enrolled agent to make sure you are making the best choice for your circumstance.\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have:The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.\nIf you’ve already filed your return, you’re probably glad to have it in the rear view mirror. But you may still have a few questions about what’s ahead.\nWhat about my refund?If you are due a refund, the IRS typically sends it within 21 days of receiving your return. When yours does arrive, itmay be smallerthan last year, even if your financial life didn’t change much. That’s because a number of Covid-related tax breaks expired.\nSo far, the average refund paid was $2,878 for the week ending April 7, down from $3,175 at the same point in last year’s filing season.\nWill I be audited?:The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. But one thing is common for the vast majority of US tax filers: Audit rates are exceedingly low.\nFor filers reporting incomes between $50,000 and $200,000, only 0.1% of them were audited in 2020, according to the latest data from the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million.\nLooking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts tofocus more on auditing high-incomeindividuals — defined as making $400,000 or more. As for filers with income below that level, he said he did not anticipate any change in the likelihood they would be audited.",

        "full_news": "Editor’s Note:A version of this story first published in 2019.\nIt’s a surprising fact that’s often overlooked in the immigration debate.\nUndocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in federal taxes annually, between tax returns filed and taxes deducted from paychecks, experts estimate.\nHere’s a look at why – and how – this is happening.\nThe National Immigration Law Centerbreaks downa number of reasonswhy undocumented immigrants pay taxes, including:\n• It shows they’re complying with federal tax laws.\n• It can help them demonstrate “good moral character” if they later have an opportunity to legalize their immigration status.\n• Tax return records could be used to document work history and presence in the US, steps that may help them be eligible for legal immigration status in the future if lawmakers pass immigration reform.\nCritics of illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are able to do so because they’re using stolen Social Security numbers. But millions of federal tax dollars are paid every year by people who don’t have Social Security numbers at all.\nRelated articleWhere immigrants come from and where they go after reaching the US\nInstead, they file using what’s known as anIndividual Taxpayer Identification Number(ITIN).\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, notesthat “most experts believe the vast majority of tax returns filed with ITINs today are filed by undocumented immigrants.”\nSome noncitizens who legally immigrated to the United States also pay taxes using this method.\nIn 2019,according to the IRS, more than 2.5 million tax returns were filed using ITINs, accounting for nearly $6 billion in taxes.\nIn addition to tax return filings, officials estimate that undocumented immigrants also contribute billions to Social Security annually through payroll tax deductions. In 2010, for example,the Social Security Administration estimatedthat payments from unauthorized workers accounted for about $12 billion in tax revenue for Social Security.\n“Undocumented immigrants pay billions in taxes to fund programs they can’t access,” the National immigration Law Centerwrotein a series of recent social media posts.\nIn 2017, Belén Sisa’s post about her experience paying taxes went viral.\n“Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday?” wrote Sisa, who was a college student in Arizona at the time.\nRelated articleDREAMer's post goes viral\nThe beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program later told CNN she felt it was important to speak out.\n“I wanted to show people that we’re here, and that we come from all over the world, and that we contribute more than people think that we do,” she said.\n“Yes,” he wrote, “undocumented immigrants are helping fund the very systems that detain and deport us.”",

Her latest film, “The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales,” co-directed with Kathleen Hughes, made its world premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. Morris Pearl is the chair of Patriotic Millionaires, and former managing director of BlackRock. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. Viewmore opinionon CNN.\nTuesday is Tax Day in America, one of the most stressful days of the year, when many taxpayers will finally end their procrastination, file their federal returns, and hope for a refund from the IRS. But for many of the nation’s wealthiest, it’s just another Tuesday.\nTax Day isn’t just a filing deadline — it’s also an annual reminder that the ultra-rich exist in an entirely separate world when it comes to taxes. For us, the loopholes are bigger and the rates are sometimes lower. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer, with thewealthof billionaires in particular growing by more than $1.5 trillion over the last few years.\nThis status quo is unfair, but even more importantly, it’s unsustainable. Such high levels of inequality are pushing our economy and our democracy to their breaking points. That’s why we should examine how we can set our country up for long-term stability and prosperity. And we should start by ensuring that the ultra-rich pay more of what they owe the country that made their success possible.\nThere are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that:\nRight now, the US tax system values money over sweat. If you work hard for your money instead of earning it passively, you’re essentially penalized for it. People who earn a salary pay significantly higher tax rates on their income than wealthy investors who passively earncapital gainsincome.\nInheriting money is an even better deal. Thanks to former president Donald Trump’s 2017tax law, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from anyestate tax, and thestepped-up basis loopholeallows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner’s death. With this, it becomes relatively simple for the rich to inherit tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars, and pay almost nothing in taxes. Someone working for that money, on the other hand, would pay over a third of it in federal income taxes.\nRelated articleOpinion: The hard lessons I learned the first time I was laid off\nWhy do we have a tax code that says working people should be taxed more than wealthy investors and those who got rich just by virtue of being born into the right family? At the end of the day, money is money, whether you worked for it or whether you inherited it. As an heiress and an investor, we should not be paying lower tax rates than people who earn their money from working.\nIt’s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income.\nWe can’t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. Capital gains are only taxed when assets are sold, so instead of selling them, the ultra-rich use their assets as collateral to borrow vast sums of money at extremely low interest rates to live on, and then declare little or even negative “income” on their tax forms. This “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy is a major reason billionaires paid alower effective tax rateover recent years than working-class families.\nBy rethinking what is taxable, we can get access to the trillions of dollars of billionaire wealth that is untouchable under our current tax structure. That’s why President Biden has proposed theBillionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires.\nFinally, one of the most straightforward changes needed is to simply tax the extremely rich more than the merely rich. Ourincome taxcaps out at a top rate of 37% for any income over $578,125 (or $693,750 for married couples). No matter how much more someone makes, they’ll never pay more than 37% in federal income taxes.\nWhile someone earning $600,000 is certainly making enough to live a very comfortable life, they’re in a different world than someone making $600 million a year. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to thetop rateswe had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. They should reach up to 90% for people making more than $100 million a year.\nThese three changes certainly won’t fix all our country’s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country’s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable. The tax code can be a powerful tool for both social and economic change. We just need to use it more effectively.",

        "headline": "'World's longest' purpose-built cycling tunnel opens in Norway",
        "full_news": "There are many ways to explore the seven mountains that surround the picturesque UNESCO World Heritage city of Bergen on Norway’s fjord-studded west coast. The newest, however, might well be record-breaking.\nA three-kilometer-long (1.8-mile) cycling and pedestrian tunnel has been blasted through the base of Løvstakken mountain and its makers say it’s the longest purpose-built tunnel of its kind.\nFyllingsdalstunnelen, as it’s known, opened on April 15 with a family day of sporting activities, following four years of construction that began in February 2019. The state-funded mega-project cost close to $29 million, or 300 million Norwegian kroner.\n“We Norwegians are usually modest people,” Camilla Einarsen Heggernes, a spokesperson for rail company Bybanen Utbygging, tells CNN, “But in this instance we would say that the tunnel is 100% state of the art.”\nIt takes a little under 10 minutes to whizz through the tunnel by bike and around 40 if strolling by foot. To break up the monotony of the windowless tunnel, there are a variety of art installations throughout, as well as different colors and lighting to help users place where they are on the journey and offer a sense of direction.\nAt the center point is a “sundial” installation – where the sun definitely will never shine – which shows the time of day, again helping to orientate visitors and also to break up the otherwise long line of sight. The tunnel is otherwise perfectly straight, apart from slight curvatures at entrance and exit.\nIf you’re wondering how cyclists and pedestrians can use the same space, there are two lanes in the tunnel: a 3.5-meter wide bike lane and a 2.5-meter-wide lane for walkers and runners. “We have laid down a blue rubber flooring throughout the tunnel, similar to an athletic track, explains Einarsen Heggernes. “This makes it more pleasant to use than if one would just walk on asphalt.”\nRelated articleThe man who cycled 870 miles for a croissant\nThe new tunnel came about as a byproduct of Bergen’s second Bybanen tram line, which opened in November 2022. The tram line through the mountain required a parallel evacuation tunnel, so the developers decided to make the new tunnel multipurpose.\nBergen is Norway’s second-largest city and the port city is linked to Oslo, the Norwegian capital, by the 496-kilometer Bergensbanen railway line. This stunning rail journey crosses Europe’s largest high mountain plateau, the Hardangervidda, and its snow-clad vistas were the backdrop for the battle scenes in the “Star Wars” sequel “The Empire Strikes Back.”\nWhile the Fyllingsdalstunnelen is pitching itself as the world’s longest purpose-built cycle tunnel, the reason for that caveat is the 3.6-kilometer-long Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington, just east of Seattle. This former train tunnel is now a passageway for cyclists, runners and walkers and is part of the 250-mile Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail.\nSix European cities made it in CNN Travel’s recent roundup of 10 of the world’smost bike-friendly cities. Copenhagen has 385 kilometers of bike lanes, having introduced its first one way back in 1892. Strasbourg in France has around 6,000 bikes available at self-service stations 24/7 which tourists can use. And the Swiss capital of Bern has a exhilarating downhill trail for riders who feel the need for speed. The best bit is that cyclists can get a funicular up to the top then ride down – no uphill struggle.",

Fake AI 'news' images are fooling social media users\n“Thank you for selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it is the first AI generated image to win in a prestigous (sic) international PHOTOGRAPHY competition. How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated? Something about this doesn’t feel right, does it?”\nHe continued: “AI images and photography should not compete with eachother in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.”\nHe said he applied “as a cheeky monkey” to find out if competitions “are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not.”\nEldagsen told CNN Tuesday: “It shows that at the moment the photographic world has been taken by surprise after this development that subtly you can create images that look like photography but you don’t need to have the skills and expertise of photographers.”\nHe said that AI had left many photographers feeling “threatened and afraid that they are going to lose their jobs which will happen.”\nEldagsen said his intention was not to create trouble, but to open up an important conversation.\n“It was not about winning anything,” he said. “I was just making a test to see if they were aware – like a hacker who hacks a system not to exploit it, but to see if there are weaknesses.”\nIn further statements on his website, he said he had informed the organizers of AI involvement.\nRelated articleFormer auctioneer admits helping to create fake Basquiat paintings\nOrganizers said that 2023 had seen the highest number of entries in the awards’ 16-year history. More than 415,000 images were entered across this year’s competitions, with more than 180,000 of them eligible for the professional categories.\nThree finalists, as well as five to seven shortlisted photographers, were chosen in each category. The selected images were shot by photographers from more than 30 countries in locations ranging from an abandoned cement factory in China to a fish market in Somalia.\nThe World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, told CNN in a statement Tuesday that, during the competition’s exchanges with Eldagsen ahead of announcing him as a category winner on March 14, he had confirmed the “co-creation” of this image using AI.\n“The creative category of the open competition welcomes various experimental approaches to image making from cyanotypes and rayographs to cutting-edge digital practices,” organizers said.\n“As such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Additionally, we were looking forward to engaging in a more in-depth discussion on this topic and welcomed Boris’ wish for dialogue by preparing questions for a dedicated Q&A with him for our website.\n“As he [Eldagsen] has now decided to decline his award we have suspended our activities with him and in keeping with his wishes have removed him from the competition. Given his actions and subsequent statement noting his deliberate attempts at misleading us, and therefore invalidating the warranties he provided, we no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.”\nThe statement said organizers recognize “the importance of this subject and its impact on image-making today.”\n“While elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium,” the World Photography Organisation added.\nTop image: Boris Eldagsen’s AI-generated image titled ‘Pseudomnesia: The Electrician’ was submitted to the Sony World Photography Awards 2023 and won first prize in the creative open category.\nCNN’s Oscar Holland contributed to this report.",

        "full_news": "What does intimacy look like for seniors? There’s no end to sex scenes and other steamy content featuring the young and unwrinkled, but past a certain age, popular culture largely draws a blank — or treats sex as a punchline.\nRelated articleCold, remote and short of women: A portrait of life on the Faroe Islands\n“My whole thought process going into it was that we’re pioneers,” she continued of the unabashedly sexualized context. “Nobody’s ever shot elder people affectionately, and with any kind of elegance. And that was my goal — to make to make them look very desirable.”\nA handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying acandid editorial featureabout seniors’ sex lives. Minter is now publishing the series in full in the forthcoming book “Elder Sex,” and exhibiting them at New York gallery LGDR. The exhibition,which opened in April, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective “Pretty/Dirty” in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work.\nIn “Elder Sex,” Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today — and despite stars such asLady GagaandLizzoposing for her — Minter couldn’t find enough real couples willing to participate.\n“We wanted to (include) all races, all types of sex,” Minter explained. “We had a lot of trouble getting models. I’m 74. I asked all my friends — in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships — and none of them would do it.”\nIn the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. She paired them together in her studio, photographing them behind a panel of frozen glass — a trick to achieve the steamy, wet look without battling the ephemerality of water vapor. During their shoots, Minter said all her models, who were as old as 89 years old, told her they still had regular, enjoyable sex lives. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged.\nMinter believes there’s a sense of freedom in sex later in life that, for many people, can take time to reach.\n“When you’re young and having sex, it’s a little more performative than it is when you’re 80,” she said. As an older person, “You’re thinking, ‘This is me. Take it or leave it. I’m just going to enjoy myself. I’m not going to fake anything here.’”\nRelated article'The Ugly Duchess:' How an unsettling Renaissance portrait challenges ideas of aging women and beauty\nMinter acknowledges that sex and self-image is fraught for women of all ages — older women are rarely seen or taken seriously as having intimate needs, while for younger women, sexual agency is often a tightrope walk — too much of it and you can be “excoriated and slut-shamed,” Minter said.\n“When you’re 25, there’s just so much fear about young women owning sexual agency — it’s just terrifying to people,” she said.\nBut the artist sees some progress in who gets to be seen as desirable on our television screens, reflecting a burgeoning broader shift in cultural attitudes around sex. She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of  “The Golden Girls” and “Sex and the City,” who are the same age at the time of the latter’s reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery). “The 50s look a lot different in the 2020s!” a caption exclaimed.\nThough “The Golden Girls” also delved into romance and intimacy — and was widely-viewed as remarkably sex-positive for its time — there’s a stark contrast in how women in their 50s are presented across the two shows.\n“I thought, ‘Okay, here’s why it’s different,” she said. “Number one: People live a lot longer, and they’re healthier… Number two: there’s this thing called Viagra.” Minter laughed, adding: “But who retired at 54? To a home in Florida with three other ladies? What?”\nShe hopes “Elder Sex” will not only serve as a much-needed visual reference for what intimacy can look like at older ages, but will also resonate for people who feel like their desires — and lives — are overlooked.\n“It gives permission to people who feel shame about their sexual urges,” she said. “I want this to give them permission to explore that and erase the shame.”\n“Elder Sex,” published by JBE Books, is available now.",

In the January to March months, retail sales grew 5.8%, mainly lifted by a surge in revenue from the catering service industry.\n“The combination of a steady uptick in consumer confidence as well as the still-incomplete release of pent-up demand suggest to us that the consumer-led recovery still has room to run,” said Louise Loo, China lead economist for Oxford Economics.\nIndustrial production also showed a steady increase.It was up 3.9% in March, compared with 2.4% in the January-to-February period. (China usually combines its economic data for January and February to account for the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday.)\nLast year, GDP expanded byjust3%, badly missing the official growth target of “around 5.5%,” as Beijing’s approach to stamping out the coronavirus wreaked havoc on supply chains and hammered consumer spending.\nAfter mass street protests gripped the country and local governments ran out of cash to pay huge Covid bills, authorities finally scrapped the zero-Covid policy in December. Following a brief period of disruption due to a Covid surge, the economy has started showing signs of recovery.\nLast month, an official gauge of non-manufacturing activity jumped to its highest level in more than a decade, suggesting the country’s crucial services sector was benefiting from a resurgence in consumer spending after the end of pandemic restrictions.\nAs the economic recovery gains traction, investment banks and international organizations have upgraded China’s growth forecasts for this year. In its World Economic Outlook released last week, the International Monetary Fund said China is “rebounding strongly” following the reopening of its economy. The country’s GDP will grow 5.2% this year and 5.1% in 2024, it predicted.\nHowever, some analysts believe the strong growth reported in the first quarter was the product of “backloading” of economic activity from the fourth quarter of 2022, which was weighed down by pandemic restrictions and then a chaotic reopening.\n“Our core view is that China’s economy is deflationary,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research, in a Tuesday research report.\nIf adjustments are made to account for the impact of delayed economic activity, GDP growth in the first quarter could have been just 2.6%, he said.\nSome key data released on Tuesday support this idea. For example, private investment was extremely weak.\nFixed asset investment by the private sector increased a mere 0.6% from January to March, indicating a lack of confidence among entrepreneurs. (State-led investment, meanwhile, advanced 10%.) That’s even worse than the 0.8% growth recorded in the January-to-February period.\nThe Chinese government has resorted tosurprising measuresto restore confidence among private entrepreneurs, but the campaign has inspired more nervousness than optimism.\nRelated articleChina resorts to unusual measures to restore confidence among entrepreneurs.

Property sales by floor area decreased by 1.8%.\n“The domestic economy is recovering well, but the constraints of insufficient demand are still obvious,” said Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the NBS, at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. “Prices of industrial products are still falling, and enterprises are facing many difficulties in their profitability.”\nUnemployment continued to surgeamong the youth.\nThe jobless rate for 16- to 24-year-olds hit 19.6% in March, up for a third straight month.

        "full_news": "Few women will be surprised to learn that even when wives earn about the same as their husbands or more, a new Pew Research Center study finds that they still spend more time on housework and child care, while their husbands spend more time on paid work and leisure.\n“Even as financial contributions have become more equal in marriages, the way couples divide their time between paid work and home life remains unbalanced,” Pew noted.\nPew found that in 29% of heterosexual marriages today, women and men earn about the same (roughly $60,000 each). “Husbands in egalitarian marriages spend about 3.5 hours more per week on leisure activities than wives do. Wives in these marriages spend roughly 2 hours more per week on caregiving than husbands do and about 2.5 hours more on housework,” the study notes.\nIn 55% of opposite-sex marriages, men are the primary or sole breadwinners, earning a median of $96,000 to their wives’ $30,000.\nRelated articleThe US gender pay gap: Why it hasn't narrowed much in 20 years\nMeanwhile, in 16% of marriages the wives outearn their husbands as the primary (10%) or sole breadwinner (6%). In these marriages women earn a median of $88,000 to their husbands’ $35,000.\nOf all of these categories, the only one in which men are reported to spend more time caregiving than their wives is when the woman is the sole breadwinner. And the time spent per week on household chores in those marriages is split evenly between husbands and wives.\nIn all instances, it’s a big change from 50 years ago — when, for instance, husbands were the primary breadwinner in 85% of marriages.\nToday, which women are most likely to be the primary or sole breadwinners can vary by age, family status, education and race.\nFor instance, Pew found Black women are “significantly more likely” than other women to earn more than their husbands. For instance, 26% of Black women bring home more than their husbands, while only 17% of White women and 13% of Hispanic women do.\nBut Black women with a college degree or higher and few children at home are also among the most likely to earn about the same as their husbands.\nThese numbers are reported against a backdrop of society’s attitudes about who should earn more and how caregiving should be divvied up between spouses.\nNearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew’s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them.\nWhat do women want? Twenty-two percent of Americans said most women want a husband who earns more, while 26% said most would want a man who earns about the same.\nMeanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. Only 19% said children are better off when their mother focuses more on home life and their father focuses more on his job.\nThe Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census’ Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January.",

(CNN has not reviewed the material.)\nIn an effort to address the heightened competition, Google is said to be developing a new AI-powered search engine called Project “Magi,” according to the Times.

        "full_news": "Best bidet attachment:Tushy Classic 3.0\nBest bidet seat:Toto Washlet C2\nBest value bidet seat:Tushy Cloud\nFinding the best bidet for your home can make a world of difference. Not only do you get a better clean, but using a bidet can also help you live a moresustainable lifeby cutting back ontoilet paper. And that’s not even mentioning the luxuries of a heated seat and dryer that will make you wonder how you ever used anormal toiletin the first place.\nNow that the taboo around washing your butt isfinally leaving America, you might be looking for your first bidet. To help you along, I’ve spent nearly four yearstesting and reviewing35 of the most popular bidets on the market to find the absolute best. Here are three I love.\nIf you’re a bidet beginner and don’t want to spend too much money, the Tushy Classic mounts under your existing toilet seat and gives you a comfortable stream with just enough adjustability.\nThe Toto Washlet C2 uses a tank, so it doesn’t provide endless warm water, but its stream and dryer were the best I tested.\nWith endless warm water and an incredibly comfortable wash, this elongated-only bidet is a fantastic option and was almost our best overall pick.\nIf you’re looking for a low-cost bidet that’s simple to set up, effective and not overly complicated, theTushy Classic 3.0is the bidet for you. Out of the attachments, the Tushy Classic 3.0 had the most comfortable stream by far, and its adjustable nozzle made it much easier than others to get a thorough clean. While it’s a bare-bones bidet, you still get a solid range of pressure and directional adjustability so you can find what feels right for you. With attachments in general, I found myself using low pressures, as their streams felt more aggressive than their electric counterparts.\nThe Tushy Classic was relatively easy to install, and the clear instructions are simple to follow, even if you’re not particularly handy. However, when installing any bidet, the most important aspect is ensuring it’s compatible with your toilet. You should also find the water connections and try removing your toilet seat beforehand so you know how everything works. Luckily, the Tushy Classic fits all two-piece toilets and most one-piece toilets (more on this below). If you’re still not sure if the Tushy will fit your specific toilet, you can find more about Tushy’s compatibilityhereand even browse through its searchable list of toiletshere.\nWhile I love the Tushy attachment, there’s one big caveat: I found that the method used to supply warm water to the Tushy Spa — and all the other hot-water bidet attachments I tested — wasn’t effective.\nSince a toilet only has a cold water supply, to get warm water with a simple attachment like the Tushy, you have to hook it up to your sink’s hot water supply. There’s no internal heater, so your water temperature is completely dependent on how quickly your sink’s water gets hot, and even then, you still have to flush out the water that’s been sitting in the hose before you get a warm wash. For that reason, I recommend you get the Tushy Classic over the Tushy Spa and avoid attachments altogether if you want to use warm water. If you prefer a heated wash, consider upgrading to an electric bidet seat, like one of our top picks, theTushy CloudorToto Washlet C2.\nTheTushy Classic 3.0is a fantastic bidet for beginners and a decent value. Of course, you could find a much cheaper option for $30 or $50, but nearly all the attachments I tried in that price range are extremely uncomfortable. If you do want to save a few bucks, I liked theLuxe Bidet Neo 185 Plus, which had solid pressure control and costs around $60. It still isn’t nearly as comfortable as the Tushy Classic 3.0, though.\nThe Tushy Classic 3.0 has a gentle yet effective stream, simple installation and easy-to-use controls, along with adjustable pressure and direction. However, if you want more features such as warm water, a heated seat or a dryer, you’ll have to shell out some more cash, but trust me, it’s worth it.\nRelated articleBest travel bidets in 2025, tried and tested\nWhile bidet attachments are a cheap way to see if you like bidets, I think most people will be happier with a more feature-filled seat with useful functions like warm water, a heated seat and a dryer. The best bidet seat I tested with all those features was theToto Washlet C2.\nThe Toto C2 stood out among its competitors for one reason: comfort. Almost no bidet I tested could match its comfortable yet effective wash-and-dry experience, which is why I think it should be the first bidet you invest in.\nThe spray of the Toto C2 uses an aerated wash that gave me the best cleaning experience out of the bidets I tried. The oscillation function on the Toto was a great way to get a fuller, more thorough clean, and it also features a front wash and pulsating feature, although I didn’t find the pulsing function to add much to the experience.\nBeyond being effective, the Toto’s stream was by far the most comfortable I tested, with a thick but gentle spray that adjusts to specific levels so you can find just the right pressure. The adjustability of the Toto’s stream is also stellar, with small but noticeable differences between each level that help you find your perfect setting.\nOnce you’re done with your wash, the dryer on the Toto C2 — just like its spray — is best in class. It felt the most comfortable, with a wide, even dry that helped me cut back on toilet paper use. Plus, you can adjust the dryer between three heat settings to find what’s most comfortable for you.\nOn top of an extremely comfortable and effective wash, the Toto also has some extra features that aren’t must-haves but make your bathroom experience all the more luxurious. One of these functions is a pre-mist feature, which turns on automatically when it senses someone sitting on the seat and sprays a mist onto your toilet bowl to lubricate the surface, which helps keep it clean. The deodorizer is also automatic, activating once you stand up to help your bathroom stay fresh. Other bidets also have features like these, so while they’re nice, you’ll probably find them on most other bidets you shop for at this price point.\nAll the controls for the Toto C2 are found on a mounted sidearm. They’re quite straightforward to use, but you might need to read through the manual first to understand how to get to all the different settings. If you want a remote for extra convenience, or you’re worried a bidet with an arm won’t fit in your bathroom, theToto Washlet C5is the same as the C2 but features a remote and added user profiles for $50 to $100 more.\nEven though remotes sound nice, I actually like bidets with sidearms better because you don’t have to worry about where the remote is or replacing batteries, and sidearms often have buttons that are labeled, unlike remotes. Bidets with remotes are also typically more expensive, so saving money by purchasing a sidearm bidet is a better value for most.\nThe Toto Washlet C2 was also quite easy to put on my toilet, and while you have to replace your seat entirely, I was surprised to find that installing electric bidet seats isn’t much more complicated than installing bidet attachments like the Tushy. However, since you’re taking off your existing toilet seat, be sure to figure out if your seat isround or elongated, and buy the corresponding bidet (more on this below). Bidet seats with dryers and warm water also need to use electricity, so make sure you have an outlet that’s close to your toilet.\nOne of the only real cons to the Toto C2 is how it heats its water. It uses a tank to store warm water for a wash, but if you use all the water in that tank, the temperature drops back down to the tap. Other bidets, like our value pick the Tushy Cloud, have technology that provides endless warm water, which can be critical if you like longer washes or if multiple people are using the bidet back-to-back. TheTushy Cloudand our previous value pick, theAlpha JX2, both have this technology, so read on to see if they’re right for you.\nThe other main downside of the Toto C2 is the size of its seat. The tank takes up a lot of room, which means if you have a round toilet, the available sitting space is smaller than most other bidets I tested. I didn’t have this problem with the elongated version, but if you’re a larger person with a round toilet, you might want to consider theAlpha JX2orTushy Cloud.\nIf you want the advantages of a full bidet seat instead of just an attachment, the Toto Washlet C2 is the bidet for you. It’s filled with the most useful features and provides a wash so comfortable and effective you’ll wonder how you ever relied solely on toilet paper.\nTushy released a slew of new bidets in late 2024 and early 2025, but one stood out above the rest: the Tushy Cloud. This bidet strikes the perfect balance of features and performance, giving you the three most impactful features — a heated seat, a heated dryer and endless warm water — for $359.\nThis bidet was so good that it nearly dethroned the Toto from our top spot. It has everything you want from a bidet and a stream so comfortable, it rivals the Toto. So, why didn’t it win? Unfortunately, the Tushy Cloud is only available in an elongated version, so folks with round toilets are out of luck. However, if you do have an elongated toilet, this is absolutely the bidet you should buy.\nWhat truly blew me away about the Tushy Cloud is its level of features for the price tag. Bidets that cost $500 or more often tout fancy extras like night lights, lids that open automatically and user presets, but the one feature that makes the price jump the most is coil-heated water. This technology allows the bidet to heat water that runs through the seat without a tank. That means your wash will be pleasantly warm right when you push the button and stay warm for as long as you want. Plus, since the Cloud doesn’t have a tank, it doesn’t look as bulky on your toilet and has more available space to sit than bidets that have to store water.\nIn previous versions of this guide, the Alpha JX2 was our pick for the best value bidet for a similar reason. It has coil-heated water for a price that won’t break the bank. However, the Tushy pushed the JX2 out of the winner’s circle this year thanks to its superior comfort. The stream of the Tushy Cloud is seriously comfy, and it’s one of the only seats that came close to the Toto in this department. Its lowest setting is comfortable for beginners, while its highest is powerful without feeling painful or sharp. Outside of the Toto, I haven’t found a stream as comfortable as this one.\nAnother great feature of the Tushy Cloud is its adjustable oscillation. Many other bidets I’ve tested have some sort of oscillation, but the Tushy Cloud (along with theCloud+andAura) is the only bidet I’ve tested with multiple levels. The first level of oscillation feels like other bidets I’ve used, but the second level covers an even wider area, so you’ll never have to scoot back and forth to ensure a good clean again.\nThe Cloud has a sibling in theTushy Cloud+, and they’re nearly identical bidets. The biggest difference is that the Cloud+ comes with a remote instead of a sidearm. Like with the Toto bidets, I think saving money and buying the bidet with a sidearm is the better choice. The Cloud’s side panel has lights for settings like temperature and pressure, which the remote of the Cloud+ doesn’t have, so I think the arm is easier and more intuitive to use.\nThe Cloud is also equipped with a dryer with three different heat settings. The dryer isn’t as powerful as the one on the Toto, so I found I had to sit and wait a bit longer. The Cloud+ has three different power levels for the dryer for a more customizable and effective experience, a feature I wish were also available on the Cloud.\nEven though the Cloud has all the important features, it doesn’t have some of the nice extras that the Toto C2 has. It doesn’t come with a deodorizer or a bowl mister, but those are just nice extras and shouldn’t be super important to your buying decision. However, the Cloud does have a night light, which the Toto does not.\nAs I mentioned before, the biggest drawback to the Cloud is that it only comes in an elongated version. I only have a round toilet in my apartment, and when I mounted the Cloud it only hangs over the bowl by a little bit. Even though it worked for me, I wouldn’t recommend trying the same since you run the risk of the bidet not fitting at all. If you do have a round toilet, I’d point you back to theToto Washlet C2. However, the round version of that bidet can feel a little small, so if you’re a larger person with a round toilet, our old value pick, theAlpha JX2, is probably the best bidet for you.\nRelated articleThe best shower heads of 2025, tried and tested\nI’ve conducted multiple rounds of testing and have formally tested 35 bidets over a period of nearly four years to find the best ones on the market. To do that, I installed each bidet and used it for at least two days, noting the effectiveness and adjustability of all its features.\nI broke up the testing into two main categories: performance and design. Within each category, I conducted various tests and examined every aspect of each bidet from ease of installation to number of features, spray quality and so much more.\nBidets have so many features, shapes and technologies that it’s hard to keep everything straight. So if you need a little guidance, I’m breaking down everything you need to know about bidets so you can have a better buying experience.\nThe simplest bidets are bidet attachments, which are installed underneath your existing toilet seat. Think of theTushy Classic 3.0: You’re not replacing your seat, just putting a thin attachment underneath it (Tushy released two attachments, theWaveandOasis, which actually replace your seat like an electric bidet. These have a sleeker look and are easier to take off and clean). These attachments are the cheaper option, but you sacrifice a lot of comfort. For one, I found the stream in all the attachments I tried to be much harsher than any of the electric bidet seats I tested. Plus, as I mentioned before, bidet seat attachments don’t have internal electric heaters, rely on hot water from your sink and, in all the options I tested, didn’t get noticeably warm during the time I spent washing.\nIf you want predictable, adjustable heating and more control over the stream, you’ll have to upgrade to an electric bidet seat. Electric bidet seats cost more, but for the investment, you get a big upgrade in experience. The streams are gentler and more effective, the water actually gets warm and you get other technologies like a heated seat and — my favorite feature — the dryer.\nElectric bidet seats with a good dryer are a great purchase because they not only give you a better experience on the toilet, but if you use the dryer after your wash, you also end up using less toilet paper, which is great for the planet and your wallet. I expected to use less toilet paper with all the bidets I tested, but quickly found that bidet attachments leave you needing to pat dry, which often takes just as much toilet paper as you’d normally use. For that reason, if cutting back on toilet paper is a big motivation for your bidet purchase, I’d recommend getting one with a dryer.\nNow, electric bidet seats vary in price due to the wide range of features and technologies available. Typically, tankless units (that use a coil heater to provide unlimited hot water) are more expensive than those that use a reserve tank to store enough hot water for a single use. Most bidets with endless hot water will cost you somewhere around $500, though one of our top picks, theTushy Cloud, and one of our previous picks, theAlpha JX2, come in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, making them a great buy.\nBefore you fall in love with an electric bidet seat, ensure there’s an outlet close to your toilet, as they need to be plugged in. The outlet in my bathroom isn’t next to the toilet, but I use an extension cord that runs across my bathroom counter to solve this problem.\nOnce you know what sort of bidet you want, ensure it fits on your toilet. In general, the first thing you’ll want to check is whether you have a one-piece toilet or a two-piece toilet. A one-piece toilet has no separation between the bowl and the tank behind it, whereas a two-piece toilet has a gap between those two elements. All bidets will fit a two-piece toilet (you will need to check the bowl shape, but more on that in a second), but some one-piece designs don’t leave enough room to fit an attachment. So if you have a one-piece toilet, you’ll want to make sure you don’t have one with a French curve (where the frame of the toilet between the bowl and the tank curves up), and you should always measure the space between the bowl and the tank to ensure it matches your desired bidet’s requirements.\nIf you want an electric bidet seat, you’ll have to measure your bowl to see if it’s elongated or round. Most come in varieties to fit both, so you’ll want to ensure the bidet you purchase fits correctly. To see which measurements are which, check outthis compatibility guide from BidetKing.\nInstalling bidets, both attachments and full seats, is surprisingly simple. You don’t need to be particularly handy; just a screwdriver and maybe a wrench will do. Most instruction manuals are straightforward, but it’s important to note that for all bidets, you’ll have to remove your existing toilet seat. Unlike most attachments, which you put back on, electric bidet seats require mounting onto your toilet and removing your old seat and lid. It’s a good idea to check your current seat mounts beforehand, as some lids have a quick-release function, while others screw off. Be sure you know how yours works, as it could affect your installation.\nIf you go into the shopping experience knowing exactly what kind of toilet you have and what type of bidet you want, it’s much easier to find the perfect one for you. Plus, installation becomes easier when you know your bidet fits.\nIf I had to pick a runner-up for the best bidet attachment, it would be this one. It's cheaper than the Tushy Classic 3.0, but it isn't as comfortable.\nThe Luxe Bidet Neo 185 Plus is a strong contender in the bidet attachment market. It’s simple to install and features easy-to-use nozzles to find your perfect stream. Many low-cost bidet attachments have poor pressure control, but the Luxe Bidet was an exception. I was able to tweak the power of the water with decent precision, leading to a much better experience than with most other attachments I’ve tested.\nHowever, the Luxe Bidet still pales in comparison to the Tushy Classic 3.0. The Tushy’s stream is much more comfortable and has even better control. The stream of the Luxe bidet felt generally more forceful and had a wider, less concentrated spray. I found myself having to pat a lot of water dry after using it. With all that said, if you want to try out a bidet and don’t want to spend $100 or more on the Tushy Classic 3.0, this is definitely the bidet to get.\nThis attachment replaces your seat entirely, which makes it easier to clean and more aesthetically pleasing.\nI really liked Tushy’s Wave bidet. It puts a new twist on bidet attachments by using the same mounting system found on electric seats. Instead of putting a slim attachment underneath your existing seat, the Wave replaces it entirely. That means you get a slimmer look without any uneven toilet seats. Plus, by using a mounting bracket, you can detach the bidet from the seat in seconds for easy cleaning.\nWhile it’s a nice upgrade from the Classic, this bidet is missing the ability to adjust the stream’s position — a basic feature I was shocked wasn’t included — and it’s quite pricey. Electric bidet seats start around $200, so I don’t think it’s worth spending close to that amount when you’re not getting a heated seat, heated water or dryer.\nI still don't like the way Tushy's attachments provide hot water, as it relies on your water heater.\nThis bidet is built just like the Tushy Wave, except it can provide a warm water wash — in theory, at least. In testing, I’ve found that the water takes an extremely long time to heat up because it’s rerouted from the hot water line of your bathroom sink faucet. Just think about how long it takes for your sink’s water to heat up; that’s how long you’ll have to wait for your bidet. I think this bidet is in an awkward middle ground and would recommend an electric bidet seat, especially at this price tag.\nThis attachment's stream simply wasn't as comfortable as the Tushy's.\nThis bidet attachment had the second-most comfortable stream behind the Tushy but wasn’t anywhere near as comfortable. It has one knob that controls both the front and rear wash, but you can’t adjust the position beyond that.\nThis bidet attachment isn't as adjustable or comfortable as the Tushy.\nThe Omigo Element+ has a dedicated front and rear wash instead of the general adjustability of the Tushy and isn’t anywhere near as comfortable to use.\nThis bidet's stream didn't feel nice at all and I wouldn't recommend it.\nThe stream on the Brondell SimpleSpa Thinline felt thin and more aggressive than the other bidet attachments I tried. It wasn’t a comfortable experience and we’d recommend the Tushy if you’re looking for a low-cost bidet.\nThis attachment is cheap, but it's so uncomfortable I wouldn't recommend it.\nIf you really want to spend the least amount of money to just test out a bidet, you could consider the Yasfel. However, it had an incredibly uncomfortable stream that would likely turn bidet newbies away. I think it’s better to spend more on a bidet you’ll actually enjoy, like the Tushy Classic 3.0.\nThis Alpha bidet seat was our previous best value bidet but was dethroned by the Tushy Cloud. If you're looking for a decently comfortable stream and endless warm water at a good price, but have a round toilet, this is the bidet for you.\nThe Alpha JX2 has been at the top of our list since I first wrote this guide in 2021. It was a special bidet in the market because it offered one of the nicest upgrades — coil-heated water — at the lowest price. It doesn’t have the most comfortable spray or dryer, but that could easily be overlooked for its tech.\nUnfortunately, the Tushy Cloud offers endless water in a more comfortable stream for $359, slightly undercutting the Alpha JX2. The JX2 has a few more features, like a bowl mist, but we don’t think those extras make up for the comfort difference. It’s still a solid bidet, though, and since the Cloud only comes in elongated, this is a great pick if you have a round toilet.\nIf you want the remote and user presets of the K300 but don't need the endless warm water, the Toto C5 is the bidet for you.\nThis bidet is a slight upgrade from my runner-up bidet seat, the Toto Washlet C2, adding a remote control and the ability to set two user presets. It’s a fantastic bidet with an ultra-comfortable stream and dryer.\nThis bidet was previously our luxury pick thanks to its instant, endless warm water and comfortable stream.\nIf you want the best of the best, check out the Toto Washlet K300. It’s expensive, but it uses coil heating to provide instant hot water for as long as you want, all with Toto’s famously comfortable stream. It also has extras like user presets for the ultimate bidet experience, but it only comes in an elongated version.\nThe Cloud+ is very similar to the Cloud and has instant hot water at a reasonable price. It uses a remote (which I didn't love) and has more dryer speeds than the Cloud.\nThe Cloud+ was a close contender for my best value bidet spot, but it lost out to the Cloud for a couple of small reasons. It’s $40 more but comes with a remote instead of a built-in arm. However, I like the arm better unless you have a super cramped bathroom. The remote is oriented horizontally, making it less easy to use with one hand compared to some other remotes I’ve tried. Additionally, the Cloud’s arm has lights that indicate the current setting, a feature the Cloud+ remote lacks.\nBut, if the controls don’t bother you, the Cloud+ has a bonus of three dryer speeds, which improves upon one of the Cloud’s only weak spots. This bidet remains a great buy, especially if you have an elongated toilet, but it couldn’t surpass its cheaper sibling for our top spot.\nThis pricey bidet has an auto-open lid, but its cramped remote and price knocked it out of contention.\nThe Tushy Aura could be a fantastic bidet for some, but unfortunately, it was quite annoying when installed in my small bathroom. The flashiest feature of the Aura is its auto-open lid, which could be helpful in a larger bathroom, but whenever I’d walk into mine, the sensor would detect movement and it would open. Even when I went in to brush my teeth and I wasn’t in front of the bidet, it’d open. This wasn’t very pleasant in my case, but your experience might be better, depending on the layout of your bathroom.\nBesides the sensitive lid, I also didn’t like its remote. Tons of random buttons filled the top, bottom and one side of the remote, making it feel too cramped. Whenever I picked up the remote, I’d accidentally hit a button on the back or side. Even without those problems, I’m unsure I’d recommend this bidet over the Cloud+, which is $200 cheaper.\nThe Washlet S2 is quite similar to our favorite seat, the C2, except it heats water instantaneously.\nIf you’re looking for a slight upgrade over both the C2 and the Tushy Cloud, the Washlet S2 is perfect for you. It has the same unrivaled comfort that I’ve come to expect from Toto, but it heats up water instantaneously, instead of relying on a tank. However, it costs over $100 more than both our winners, which can be hard to justify for a lot of folks.\nThis seat is an even more upgraded version of the Toto bidets I love, but the price is just too high for anyone but the most bidet-obsessed.\nThis seems to be the K300’s successor, as it has coil-heated water, user profiles and extra features like a night light. If you’re looking for one of the best bidet experiences, this is the one to buy. But it’ll cost you a pretty penny.\nThis bidet only comes in elongated versions and wasn't as comfortable to use as other bidets we tested, especially when it came to its dryer.\nThe Eco Nova Bidet Seat has instant, unlimited water but couldn’t stack up to the Tushy Cloud in overall comfort. Its stream wasn’t too bad, but its dryer felt uncomfortably hot. It also had a slightly different installation process, so even if you’re familiar with bidets, you should read the instructions. Our last, small issue with this bidet is that its lid would always fall by itself on our toilet, which didn’t happen with any other bidets we tested.\nIf all you want is a comfortable stream, this Toto bidet is a decent option, but I think the warm air dryer of the C2 is worth the extra money.\nThe most budget-friendly of Toto’s Washlet Bidet Series, the A2 includes many of the great features as the C2 — warm water, dual action spray with oscillator, adjustable water temp and volume settings, heated seat with temperature control and that convenient arm control panel we love. It’s high on comfort and ease of use, but for less than $100 more, the C2 provides warm air drying with three temperature settings, an automatic deodorizer, technology that auto-cleans the wand and it also comes in round-front bowl styles.\nIf you don't want to commit to spending as much for a bidet seat, this is another solid option, but it isn't as feature-filled as the C2.\nIf you’re ready to test the bidet seat, er, waters, I highly recommend this slim-profile model. It was easy to install once we traded out the toilet supply line hose for a longer, more flexible $10 piece from the hardware store, and we like that it comes loaded with features, including warm water, an adjustable heated seat, a seat sensor to keep any accidental sprays from happening, a warm air dryer, adjustable water pressure and even a night light.\nI also appreciate that it boasts a self-cleaning feature that rinses the nozzles before each use and that it offers a variety of wash options: front, rear, turbo, pulse and standard. But the controls are located on the sides of the seat, which makes them much less intuitive to use than the Toto Washlet C2 ,and the Toto’s stream and dryer also prove to be more comfortable. Still, for $220, it’s a great choice.\nStill a great bidet, the Brondell couldn't beat out the Toto.\nThis bidet is a solid option with a comfortable and effective stream. Its spray wasn’t quite as good as Toto’s, and its dryer didn’t cover the wide area that Toto’s did, but it was comfortable, and in general, I enjoyed using this bidet.\nSimilar to the LE89, this great Brondell bidet comes with a remote.\nThe LE99 Swash from Brondell is very similar to the LE89, but instead of a sidearm control panel, you can adjust all its settings with a remote control. Just like the LE89, it’s a solid bidet, but it could use some improvements on its dryer.\nThe stream and dryer of this bidet just weren't as comfortable as the Toto or the Alpha JX2.\nThe spray on the Brondell Swash DS275 wasn’t as good as that on the Toto Washlets. And similar to the other Brondell bidets, I didn’t think the dryer was as effective as the Toto’s. It does come with a massage function and a deodorizer, but I think the oscillation of the Toto C2 and Alpha JX2 do the job better, and if you want a deodorizer, go with a Toto.\nThis bidet's uncomfortable dryer held it back from top contention.\nThe new version of the Alpha Bidet iX Hybrid — which I also tried in our first round of testing — has tankless heating, but its dryer was uncomfortable. After using the dryer for about 20 seconds, the back of the seat began to get hot, so much so that leaning back on it wasn’t an option.\nThis bidet's bulky and glitchy remote was its downfall.\nThis bidet’s stream and dryer felt decent, but its remote was much worse than that of our winners. Its circular design wasn’t comfortable to hold, and it required two hands to use it easily. Plus, I had some pairing issues with the remote and the bidet that were quite frustrating.\nThe Coway's stream and dryer couldn't keep up with that of our top picks.\nThe Bidetmega 150’s spray wasn’t nearly as comfortable as the Toto’s or the Alpha JX2’s, and the dryer wasn’t as effective as either of our picks. Plus, installing the Coway bidets was the hardest of all the options I tested. The T-valve you use to connect your bidet to your bathroom’s water line is divided into parts, meaning you have to find the properly sized adapters to attach the bidet. It adds an extra, confusing step and also gives the connection more points where it could leak.\nIf you can't find the Toto K300 or want a cheaper luxury bidet, check out this Bio Bidet.\nIf you want a luxury bidet but can’t find the Toto K300, we’d pick the Bio Bidet BB-2000 Bliss. It didn’t perform quite as well as the Toto K300, but it has a very comfortable spray and dryer, and its massage function was my favorite stream pattern out of all the bidets I tested. The remote is more complicated than the Toto’s, so it takes a while to learn what all the symbols mean and what they do.\nIf you like Tushy, you'll love this luxury bidet. However, the other bidets we recommend are more comfortable and feature-filled.\nThe Tushy Ace was another solid luxury contender, but its stream and dryer comfort just couldn’t cut it against the Toto K300. It also lacks the extra features of the K300, such as user presets, pre-mist and a deodorizer. But if you’re a Tushy loyalist, you won’t be let down.\nThis bidet's lagging remote knocked it down in my rankings.\nThis bidet was a strong contender on paper, but in use, I didn’t like it nearly as much as our top picks. The stream was comfortable, but not as comfortable as the Toto or the Tushy. My biggest issue with this seat, however, was its remote. It would often take multiple presses for the bidet to start and stop, which was quite an annoying experience.\nI thought other bidets were more comfortable and easier to install than this one.\nThe Coway Bidetmega 400 had a similarly frustrating installation process as the cheaper Coway bidets. The Bidetmega 400 has more features than the 150 and 200; however, its spray wasn’t as comfortable or effective as other top contenders, even though it automatically goes through a four-stage washing cycle unique to Coway bidets. It’s a nice luxury bidet, but if you’re willing to spend slightly more, I think you’ll be better served by a Toto or the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000.\nThis bidet's stream and dryer were lacking compared to other high-end bidets.\nThe Brondell Swash 1400 and Omigo Luxury Bidet seemed to be the exact same bidet seat with different branding. The Swash 1400 didn’t have the most comfortable stream, and its dryer felt like it was only hitting half of the area it needed to. If you’re spending this much money on a bidet, I recommend theToto K300or theBio Bidet Bliss BB-2000.\nThis bidet seemed to be the same as the Brondell Swash 1400 and had the same issues.\nThe Omigo Luxury Bidet felt and looked identical to the Brondell Swash 1400 and had similar problems, with a lackluster spray and ineffective dryer.\nEditor’s Note:We previously tested the Alpha Bidet iX Hybrid Bidet Toilet Seat, the Alpha Bidet JX and the Coway Bidetmega 200 Electric Bidet Seat, but they have since been discontinued and removed from this article.\nFirst, locate and close the toilet’s water valve, then flush the toilet to empty the tank. Take off your existing toilet seat and clean the bowl. If you have a bidet attachment, put it on the bowl, then reattach your toilet seat on top of it. If you have a full bidet seat, you’ll have to screw in a mounting bracket and slide the seat on. The bidet will come with a T-valve and some hoses that you’ll need to connect to your existing water connection (making sure everything is screwed down correctly is the most critical step to prevent leaks. Use plumber’s tape if you need to). Once all the hoses are connected, slowly turn the water back on, wait 10 to 15 minutes and check for leaks. If there are no leaks, you can plug in your electric bidet seat and start using it.\nBidet attachments can range from about $30 to over $100. You won’t pay too much more for an attachment because they’re quite simple. Electric bidet seats, however, have a wide range of pricing that depends on features, but the typical range for most bidets is between $250 and $700.\nMost bidets nowadays will have a nozzle that cleans itself, but it’s still a good idea to occasionally give the whole bidet a solid clean. Check your manual, but you should take your bidet off the toilet, empty its tank of water if it has one, and use a bathroom cleaner to remove any mildew or buildup on the bidet.\nCNN Underscored editors thoroughly test all the products we cover and provide complete transparency about how we test them.

But many of theseeco-friendly productsaren’t worth the cash, whether they’re poorly made, exorbitantly priced or just plaingreenwashed. We know this because we test dozens of products a year at CNN Underscored, and many don’t live up to the hype.\nHowever, every once in a while, an eco-friendly product impresses us. For this comprehensive guide, I’ve rounded up all the planet-friendly standouts CNN Underscored staffers have tried and loved over the years, includingreusable water bottles, recyclableskin carefinds and plenty of swaps for single-use plastics.\nFor those looking forsustainable skin care, Alpyn’s Beauty Barrier Repair Cream is agreat moisturizerfor all skin types. It has the seal of acceptance from the National Eczema Association so it’ssensitive skin-friendlyand packed withnourishing peptidesandceramides. On top of usingrecyclable packagingwhere possible, Alpyn utilizes wildcrafted and circular-harvested ingredients from its home state of Wyoming, and a portion of every purchase is donated to rewilding efforts for Grand Teton National Park.— Sophie Shaw, fashion and beauty editor\nThis balancing oil cleanser from Botnia is my new skin care secret weapon. It has recyclable and compostable packaging, is cruelty-free and uses clean ingredients. It leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, and you don’t even have to use a lot of product to get all of the great benefits. Definitely a great sustainable swap for your current cleanser. —Gabriella Triolo, social coordinator\nIn the beauty industry, there’s a perceived crossroads where sustainable products and effective products diverge, but Ethique is a brand that’s been showing how the two lanes can merge seamlessly. Thezero-wasteshampoo and conditioner bars are some of my favorite hair care products I’ve come across in the past few years. They lather, cleanse and treat my hair even better than some of the traditional shampoos and conditioners I’ve tried.— Sophie Shaw, fashion and beauty editor\nI love toself-tan, but I hate that almost every “viral” brand I’ve tried comes in a single-use plastic bottle. After lots of trial and error, I finally found a tanner that doesn’t make me look orange and comes in a gorgeous, refillable amber glass bottle. The Saltyface set is also accompanied by an aluminum foaming lid and face and body brushes with vegan bristles that are fully recyclable. It may be pricey, but investing in a quality product that helps reduce your carbon footprint while you’re at it is worth it. —Stephanie Griffin, director of social\nEverist wants to do away with the single-use plastic that bath and body products usually come in, so instead, the company makes concentrated shampoo, conditioner and body wash formulas that cut back on waste in more ways than one. The plant-based paste formulas are made without water, and each of the aluminum tubes comes with a key that helps you dispense every drop of product. When you’re done, the tubes can be recycled and the plastic caps can be sent back to Everist to participate in the brand’s Cap Back Program. —Sophie Shaw, fashion and beauty editor\nWhen I think of Lush, I automatically think of colorful bath bombs and cruelty-free products. I’ve been obsessed with the brand’s soap for years now, and this refreshing mint and eucalyptus blend is one of my favorites. I love the citrus oils infused in this bar, and I feel even better using it knowing it’s made with natural and 95% vegan product, with thoughtfully sourced raw materials. —Carolina Gazal, associate testing writer\nI was excited to learn about aneco-friendly alternativeto the standard hair elastic, especially since they have a habit of disappearing and you never really know where they end up. Terra Ties are 100% biodegradable, and if you think that means they sacrifice performance for eco-friendly materials, they absolutely don’t. The organic cotton and rubber elastics are perfectly sturdy and stretchy. —Sophie Shaw, fashion and beauty editor\nAvoiding plastic is tough, especially with all the soaps, cleansers and skin andhair carein my daily routine. In an effort to cut back, I swapped my plastic shampoo and conditioner bottles for these bars. These last me just as long as the bottles and cost about the same. Plus, this way I know I'm getting every ounce of product possible, down to the very final suds, and I keep unnecessary plastic out of my bins. —Jillian Tracy, associate editor\nAfter a constant battle with dark smudges around my eyes, I started exclusively usingtubing mascaraslast year, and now there’s no going back. My current favorite is Caliray’s formula, which adds volume and manages to keep my very straight lashes lifted (after curling, of course). Even better, the brand is transparent about its sustainability efforts throughout the line, and the [mascara tube] is made from 100% recycled ocean plastic. —Sophie Shaw, fashion and beauty editor\nKlean Kanteen is doing something really cool in the drinkware space by creating more and more products withcertified 90% postconsumer recycled steel. Thisinsulated mugis one of those products, and I’ve been loving how hot it keeps my morning coffee, not to mention its gorgeous looks. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nI adoreRumpl’s puffy blanketsbecause they’re so warm and cozy. The designs are great, and they’re made with a tear-resistant material that makes it the perfect blanket to take to the backyard, camp, the park or anywhere else. Oh, and each Original Puffy is made from 60 recycled plastic bottles. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nI’m a huge hammock fan. Whether I’m on my patio, in a park or at a campsite, I always have a hammock handy. If the sun’s out, I want to be in a hammock. I’ve been an Eno fan for years, but I finally tried Kammok’s hammocks and instantly fell in love. They’re lighter in weight but stronger, thanks to the brand’s amazing 100% recycled, bluesign-approved fabric. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nI've used a few different metalwater bottlesover the years, but the Iron Flask has been in permanent rotation ever since I got one. Its straw lid makes it easy to grab a quick sip of water when I'm at my desk or shooting hoops, and my 22-ounce model provides an ample amount of hydration on the go (not to mention ample room for the many, many stickers I've slapped onto it).— Mike Andronico, senior tech editor\nI don’t think I’ve bought a single plastic water bottle since buying this Hydro Flask. It holds a ton of water, so it’ll last me all day, and it’s super easy to clean too. I take it with me everywhere I go! —Tyler Holender, social strategist\nNot only can this GIANT water bottle, which holds 64 ounces, get me through an entire day without getting up to refill (or ever buy another bottle of spring water), but Takeya’s products have helped eliminate over 12 billion single-use plastic bottles. Plus, I get to “Hydrate & Celebrate” every night at 8 p.m. What a perk! —Tobey Grumet Segal, health, fitness and food editor\nI’ve been enjoying Nomadix’s lightweight, ultra-absorbent and quick-drying towels for a while, but the one I’ve fallen the most in love with is the Bandana Towel. It’s super tiny and can be folded down so small it could easily fit in your pocket. I love keeping it on hand to use during workouts or on hikes to wipe sweat away. The best thing about it? It’s made from 88% postconsumer recycled polyester. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nWhen I swore off single-use plastic in 2020, this water bottle from Stojo became my go-to! It’s made of LFGB-certified silicone, holds a whopping 20 ounces of water when full and comes with an airtight, screw-on cap that literallyneverleaks. The coolest part, though, is that it’s collapsible, so it can shrink down in size and lie flat when you’re working with limited space. —Stephanie Griffin, director of social\nAllbirds has been a popular and innovative brand in the eco-friendly shoe scene for years now and for good reason. The brand makes sneakers that are much better for the Earth than traditional kicks, plus they’re super comfortable and look good too. I got a pair ofTree Dasherslast year and wear them when I go for runs or when I just want a plush,cozy sneakerto walk around town in. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nMy new go-to work bag, this cute Baggu piece, is roomy enough to fit my 13-inch laptop, charger,compact umbrellaand more. It’s made out of recycled nylon that feels durable enough to carry my essentials and withstand the daily strains of toting it around the city. The strap is also adjustable and long enough that I can even wear it crossbody. —Sophie Shaw, fashion and beauty editor\nAfter researching and reporting onsustainable fashion brands, two of the experts I talked to recommended Outerknown. I had never heard of it before, but I finally got around to trying some of Outerknown’s clothes, and I am beyond impressed. My favorite piece so far is its famous Blanket Shirt, which is a heavy flannel made from 100% organic cotton. It feels incredibly well made, extremely cozy and by far my favorite flannel. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nGreenwashingruns rampant in thefashion industry, but Patagonia remains a paragon of sustainability. The company’s most striking move was totransfer its ownership to a nonprofit and trustdedicated to ensure its profits go toward fighting climate change. Patagonia gear — like this lightweight, extra-warmNano Puff hoodiethat I wear weekly — is also backed by the company’slifetime guarantee.— Maxwell Shukuya, associate updates writer\nThis is hands down the most beautiful,high-quality piece of swimwearI own. It features a backless design, a matching belt and built-in padding, and overall it’s just super flattering and really sucks everything in while still allowing some stretch! This piece is constructed of recycled materials, such as fishing nets, and comes in a box made of reused algae from areas where too much would otherwise harm the fragile ocean ecosystem. Also, I love that the brand donates a portion of its sales toThe Coral Reef Alliance. —Stephanie Griffin, director of social\nThese have been some of myfavorite sunglassesfor the past year because they don’t have arms and instead stay secure on your face with an adjustable cord that wraps around your head. Plus, Ombraz uses some sustainable materials to craft its sunglasses, such as 100% recycled nylon for the cord, and packages them in compostable packaging with soy-based ink. What I really love about the brand, though, is itscommitment to planting 20 mangrove trees for every pair of sunglasses sold. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nI’ve gone long about how much I loveTushy’s affordablebidets, but in short, they’re life-changing. It’s my most recommended product to every person around me whose toilets I frequent (or not), and it does legitimately help save you from buying so much toilet paper. We named this one thebest bidet attachment of the yearlargely because of how easy it is to install, its simple design and its easily adjustable water pressure. —Rachel Lubitz, former senior lifestyle editor\nUnlike other adhesive bandages, WoolAids are made with merino wool rather than plastic. Not only will a WoolAid biodegrade in four months, but while it’s on, the skin and wound underneath can breathe and thus stay dry rather than getting that unpleasant soggy feeling. They also come in colors like blue and gray instead of attempting to match any kind of “flesh” tone, and they stay on forever.—Rena Behar, copy editor\nSaying goodbye to single-use plastics at the grocery store is an easy way to become more environmentally sound. I love my Baggu bag for trips to the grocery store — or Target or CVS or Sephora — because it can fit pretty much everything I buy in one bag and be carried like a tote over my shoulder. Plus, it holds up to 50 pounds, so it’s reliably sturdy. Perhaps best of all, it folds into its own flat pouch for easy storage out of the way. —Emily McNutt, former senior travel editor\nFinding a good,quality candlecan be difficult especially since there are so many options out there. But ever since I came across Lumira’s candles, I can never go back to just using any old brand. The glass packing is 100% recyclable, so once your candle goes through its 80 hours of burn time, (yes, it lasts forever) you can repurpose it! The candle is also made from all-natural ingredients and is cruelty-free and sustainably sourced. Once you try one out, you’ll just have to get them all! —Gabriella Triolo, social coordinator.\nIt makes absolute sense that this naturally pink-hued specialty vodka from Origen Holistic Spirits was founded by none other than sustainability warrior Woody Harrelson. Not only is it distilled from the all-natural extracts of elderberry, muscadine grape, green tea and artichoke but it also eschews artificial flavors, colors and additives, all while boasting absolutely no GMOs. —Tobey Grumet Segal, health, fitness and food editor\nSubstituting reusable makeup remover pads for disposable ones is one of the easiest ways I’ve cut down on unnecessary waste over the past year. These are soft and easy to clean, and they come with a storage pouch to keep things organized. —Sophie Shaw, fashion and beauty editor\nI love usingstorage containers, specifically this nontoxic, nonstick 14-piece set from Caraway. Not only does it preserve the life of my lunch or dinner leftovers, but it's a great alternative to single-use plastic wrap or tin foil. —Stephanie Griffin, director of social\nI’ve been usingWho Gives A Crap toilet paperfor years and absolutely love it. It feels just like normal toilet paper, and the brand donates 50% of its profits to help build toilets around the world. I’ve been using the brand’s bamboo toilet paper recently, but for my next order, I’m going to switch to the100% Recycled Toilet Paperbecause it has a smaller environmental impact. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nTheseBee’s Wrap wrapstook a bit of getting used to, but once I learned how to properly use them (warm them up and mold them a bit first with the heat from your hands), they quickly became one of my kitchen staples. I use far less single-use plastic (plastic wrap, plastic baggies, etc.) and foil, thanks to this product. It’s super easy to wash and reuse, and it keeps food fresh the same way plastic wrap might. —Hayley Saltzman, former head of social\nIf you’re a regular Underscored reader, you know how much we loveour Swedish dishcloths, and these ones, gifted to me by my mom, have made my kitchen both cuter and more eco-friendly. With an array of cat-related designs, my mom actually took three for herself, and I can’t blame her. They’re excellent at soaking up messes and can be thrown right into the washing machine after heavy use. I’m already planning on buying more. —Rachel Lubitz, former senior lifestyle editor\nI’ve had this super-sturdy, airtight and leakproof container for years and absolutely love it. Whenever I have leftovers to store, this is the first container I reach for because it keeps food so fresh. I especially love that it’sactuallyleakproof; you could use it as a lunch container and take soup to the office without a worry. —Kai Burkhardt, outdoors, sustainable living and pets editor\nI discovered this chocolate within the past year, and it is SO GOOD. The fun branding is obviously a huge draw (the colors! The name! The funky shape of the chocolate bar when you break it up into pieces!), but the flavor combos and the high-quality chocolate are what keep me recommending it to everyone I know. I just learned that on top of all of its other merits, Tony’s is also eco-friendly, using 100% traceable beans and sustainable practices. Yes, please! —Hayley Saltzman, former head of social\nI made the switch to Save Trees’ paper towels a couple of months ago, and I haven’t looked back since. Each roll comes with 150 100% bamboo sheets and is delivered to your doorstep in two-, three- or four-month increments in a totally plastic-free, recyclable and compostable box.

Effortlessly stylish while consistently functional and high quality, the brand’s range of button-downs is crucial when it comes to such an essential piece. “They offer more cuts, patterns and colors than can fit in a single wardrobe, so there is truly something for everyone,” Smith adds.\nA revamped version of the brand’s bestselling and incredibly versatile Secret Wash shirt, this classic yet fun button-down is made from a 100% premium cotton material that’s both super smooth and strong.\n“When I think of spring fashion, I think of lightweight layering,” Smith says. “It’s also when we start seeing color make a comeback.” This twill shirt is a perfect transitional piece: You can wear it on its own or over a short-sleeve or long-sleeve tee.\nIf you love a good printed shirt, opt for this textured sweater tee.

When it’s too cold for just a T-shirt, but [I] don’t want a bulky jacket, this is my go-to.”\n“As the weather starts to warm up, your outerwear choice can sometimes be tricky,” says Snyder, who recommends this jacket. “I always opt for transitional weather staples that you can easily layer with.”\nA lightweight blazer is the perfect transitional springtime piece, and this cotton-linen option has it all.

The brand is super transparent about the associated costs of each product and even compares the cost of each of its products to those of similar brands as well as traditional retail cost. While Quince is a popular brand for all types of sustainable clothing at a great price point, the markdowns on traditionally pricey items like cashmere sweaters and durable outerwear are absolutely worth calling out.\nThe café racer is a sleek, easygoing alternative to the traditional biker leather jacket. This stylish option is made from 100% top-grain leather and rings in at under $200.\nBomber jackets are an effortless outerwear option for all sorts of transitional weather, and this 100% suede option sports an inner lining to keep you warm and comfortable even on chillier days.\nSan Francisco-based menswear brand Taylor Stitch was founded in 2008 with the goal of creating versatile clothing that’s meant to last far beyond a couple seasons.

We may receive a commission through ouraffiliate partnersif you apply and are approved for a product, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\nIf you’re wondering how to file taxes for the 2022 tax year before it’s too late, you’ll be glad to know that you still have some time. The tax deadline falls on April 18 this year, and if you file an extension, you’ll have until Oct. 16, 2023, to submit your 2022 tax return. Most states also require filing an income tax return with similar deadlines.\nBut regardless of how long you have until tax day rears its ugly head, it’s crucial to get a handle on the process and the steps you need to take. Let’s go over the details of exactly how to do your taxes, tax preparation methods to consider and what to do if you don’t have the money to pay your taxes by the deadline.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officially opened the door to taxpayers who wanted to file their 2022 returns on Jan. 23, 2023. This means that individuals and families could have filed their taxes any time since then, although it’s often smarter to wait until all the required documentation is in hand before getting started.\nSpeaking of that, theIRS encouraged everyone to have everything they need before filing their taxesthis year. “Filing an accurate tax return can help taxpayers avoid delays or later IRS notices,” the agency wrote. Ensuring your return is accurate before you file can save you time and makes it less likely that you’ll need to file an amended return.\nFor the vast majority of Americans, the deadline to file either a 2022 personal federal tax return or a request for an extension is Tuesday, April 18, 2023. While the tax filing deadline normally falls on April 15, the deadline was moved to April 18 this year due to the Emancipation Day holiday in the District of Columbia.\nEither way, note that this deadline is not just for filing — it’s the date that all taxes owed must bepaidas well. This is true even if you’re requesting an extension to file your actual tax return. In fact, the IRS is very clear that taxpayers must pay their estimated bill in full in order to avoid potentialinterest and penalties. So if you don’t have the cash, you’ll either need to use a credit card to pay your taxes or request a payment plan from the IRS. More on these options below.\nThere are numerous strategies you can use to file your tax return if you haven’t yet, and some of them come with assistance if you need it. For starters, individuals can turn to tax software for help, which can expedite the process considerably. Some of the best tax software programs even let consumers file basic returns for free.\nAs an example,TurboTaxlets you file on your own or with assistance from a professional, with costs that range from $0 for self-guided, basic filing to $389 for full-service tax filing assistance. You can also choose a mid-tier tax assistance plan that helps you move through the process of filing your tax return on your own with the help of a live assistance via online chat.\nH&R Blockoffers similar plans, with the option to self-file or get help filing your taxes online. The company’s free version, called H&R Block Free Online, also lets you file basic tax returns at no cost, but you can pay more for more complex returns or help from a tax pro.\nOther ways to file your taxes include:\nNote that these tax filing methods are geared to individuals or families filing a basic tax return. However, the IRS offers more filing information for businesses and self-employed people, international taxpayers and charities and nonprofits onits website.\nWhile the method you choose to file your taxes can vary based on your income and how complicated your return is, here are seven steps that anyone can follow.\nStep 1: Gather your paperwork.Before you prepare to file your taxes, you should gather all the paperwork you’ll need. This can include a W-2 form from your employer, earning and interest statements from investments (1099and1099-INTforms) and receipts for charitable donations and other write-offs if you plan to itemize.\nStep 2: Decide how to file.While you can file a tax return through the mail, the IRS suggests filing online for faster processing and speedier refunds. You can also utilize a professional to help, take advantage of tax software or file using the time-honored paper and pen.\nStep 3: Select the appropriate filing status.Your filing status will be based on whether you’re single, married or head of your household, along with other less common tax situations. You’ll also want to claim any dependents — which is typically aqualifying child or relative— as part of your return.\nStep 4: Determine whether you are itemizing or taking the standard deduction. Most taxpayers with basic returns can use the standard deduction for 2022, which is $25,900 for married couples filing jointly and $12,950 for single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately.\nStep 5: If you owe, decide how to pay.If you’re not receiving a tax refund and you wind up owing money to the IRS for the 2022 tax year, you need tomake a tax paymentor apply for a payment plan. Also note that it’s possible to pay taxes with a credit card in many cases.\nStep 6: Choose how you want your refund.If you’re owed money from the IRS this year, you’ll need to specify how you want it sent to you. Options include direct deposit into a bank account, a prepaid debit card or a mobile app with direct deposit.\nStep 7: Finish the process by tax day.Submit your tax return by the tax deadline for your state to avoid potential penalties and interest.\nGenerally speaking, you’ll learn which tax credits you may be eligible for as you move through the steps to file your taxes online. This is especially true if you use tax software, since these programs ask you specific questions that ensure you receive every tax credit you’re eligible for.\nFor example,TurboTaxsearches for tax deductions and credits as you file with the goal of helping you boost your refund. This type of help can be essential if you’re in a situation where you aren’t sure which tax credits apply, such as having student loans or being in a low tax bracket.\nIf your goal is getting your tax refund as quickly as possible, you should know that the IRS recommends filing electronically and choosing direct deposit as your method of payment. The agencyalso notesthat most taxpayers will receive their refund within 21 days of their electronic filing date, provided no issues are detected.\nSome returns may require manual review, however, in which case processing can take longer. The IRS also reports that, in cases where problems are detected but they can be resolved without corresponding, taxpayers will receive an explanation in the mail of changes that were made by the agency.\nIf you’re not ready to file your taxes and you’re running out of time, the IRS has a formal process for requesting an extension. However, the extension only gives you more time to file your tax return — any taxes you owe are still due by April 18, 2023.\nTo qualify for an extension, taxpayers must take one of the following steps:\nIf you don’t file your return or an extension request by the deadline, thefailure to file penaltyis 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late, up to a maximum of 25% of your unpaid taxes. And if you owe money and don’t pay by the deadline, thefailure to pay penaltyis 0.5% of your unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that you’re late, up to a maximum of 25% of what you owe. In either case, interest will be charged on the outstanding amount as well.\nNotice that the monthly penalty for not filing is much higher than the penalty for not paying? That’s why it’s vital to get your return filed or request an extension by the deadline, even if you don’t have the money to pay what you owe.\nHowever, that doesn’t mean you should ignore the bill. Taxpayers who cannot pay the tax they owe by April 18 should set up a payment plan with the IRS as soon as possible. There are two different ways to apply for a payment plan:\nNote that taxes paid on a payment plan will accrue interest based on how much is owed and how long it takes to be paid in full. Interest rates are adjusted every three months and can vary based on your tax filing status. That’s why it can sometimes make sense to pay taxes with a credit card if you can qualify for a credit card with a 0% introductory interest rate on purchases.\nIn any case, it’s important to make sure you take care of your taxes one way or another by the deadline. Ignoring them won’t make them go away, and will eventually lead to larger problems down the line. So if you can’t file or can’t pay on time, make sure to reach out to the IRS by April 18 to request an extension and/or payment plan, and keep your taxes from turning into a bigger burden.\nNeed a way to pay your taxes without interest?

        "headline": "Composting is an easy way to reduce food waste. Here's how to do it",
        "full_news": "If you want to helptake care of the planet, there are many things you can do on an individual level tobe more sustainable. You can use eco-friendly products likeSwedish dishcloths,reusable bagsandbidets. You can drive less or switch to moresustainable fashion brandsandshoes. But if you still want to reduce your impact on the planet, there’s another simple solution that everyone can do: composting.\nFood waste is a huge contributor to climate change; in fact,according to the World Wildlife Fund, “about 6% to 8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced if we stop wasting food,” and in the U.S. alone, food waste emits about the same amount of greenhouse gasses as 32.6 million cars.\nThe EPA estimates that overone-third of food is wastedin the US, making it the most common material in landfills. And when food sits in those landfills, it’s unable to decompose. “When organic material (such as food scraps) is sent to the landfill, it is unable to break down naturally, but instead produces methane, a harmful greenhouse gas,” says Elena Lopez, outreach and communications manager atLA Compost, a nonprofit that helps improve compost access and education. So much food sits in landfills that,according to the EPA, “globally, food loss and waste represent 8% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.”\nIf you want to lessen your own carbon impact, composting your food waste is a great way to start. But if you think composting by yourself is daunting and reserved only for communes and farmers, there’s no need to worry. We talked to compost experts, all who say it’s actually quite simple once you learn the basics.\n“Compostingis one of the most important and relatively easy steps we can take to realign our lives and society with Earth,” says Rob Greenfield, environmental activist and author of several books, including “Zero Waste Kids: Hands-On Projects and Activities to Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.”\n“First, it keeps food out of the landfill where it emits methane and other gasses that we don’t need. In the landfill wasted food can sit for decades, because a landfill is not designed for decomposition,” Greenfield says. “Next, it turns wasted resources like food waste, leaves and paper and turns it into rich compost that can be used to grow our own food and regenerate our depleted land.”\nCompost is a soil chock-full of nutrients that’s created after organic matter breaks down. This soil is the end result of a decomposition process that occurs naturally, but one that we can mimic at home through several composting techniques. “When organic materials are composted, the process of composting allows the material to fully break down,” says Lopez. “The result is a finished compost product that is used to amend soils by adding nutrients that help many edible plants grow and thrive.”\nIf you want to try composting, there are plenty of ways to do it in your backyard, or even in your kitchen. “There are a number of options for composting at home, including worm bins, bokashi, food recycler systems and a variety of backyard systems,” says Tara McKenna, author of “Don’t Be Trashy: A Practical Guide to Living With Less Waste and More Joy” and founder ofThe Zero Waste Collective. “It’s mostly a matter of picking the right option for your family, and your living situation.”\nWe’ll dive into all the different ways you can compost, but before you choose which one is best for you, it’s important to know how composting actually works. It may seem complicated because there are so many different methods, but at its root composting is very simple.\n“There are four essential elements of the composting process. The first, nitrogen, is what you might typically think of when you think of compost, food scraps! We call them ‘greens.’ Other green materials include green leaves, coffee grounds, eggshells and other materials that were once living,” says Lopez. “Next is carbon, or what we call ‘browns.’ Browns include mulch, dried leaves, sawdust, newspaper clippings and brown paper towels and bags.” Along with greens and browns, Lopez says compost also needs oxygen and water to keep the organisms that break down your food alive and well.\n“Once you understand these elements, you will simply collect your greens, add them to your compost system and layer browns over the greens each time,” Lopez says. “This is called ‘lasagna composting,’ due to the layering.” Lopez says you should turn and water your compost regularly, and your pile will start to shrink as the composting process begins.\nWhile you’re composting, you’ll want to monitor the system to make sure it has enough of each of the four elements. Lopez says any problems that arise can most likely be solved by adjusting your ratio. “Pile isn’t heating up? Try adding more greens or turning more often. Getting odors or pests? Add more browns,” she says. “Composting is a natural process and is all about creating the right environment for organisms to live and do their jobs breaking down the organic material.”\nHowever, depending on what method of composting you use, this ratio can differ. “It’s always dependent on the system. Every system has its own rules and that’s why you’ve got to know what you’re making and how you’re making it,” Rebecca Louie, master composter and author of “Compost City: Practical Composting Know-How for Small-Space Living,” says. “Someone’s not going to hand you a Cuisinart and then you’re gonna use it like a pizza stone. It’s a completely different thing.”\nLouie likes to compare composting to making a cocktail. “There is a basic recipe for it, but you have to find out the precise elements that work for you, the right ratio for things,” she says. Louie (akaThe Compostess) says you need to take into account all factors, such as if your environment gets really hot or cold and what sort of food scraps you plan on composting. “The goal, ultimately, is to create a system that is optimal for the bacteria to step in.”\nTo ensure your compost is friendly to bacteria, Louie says the amount of moisture in your system is critical. “The ideal balance and texture coming out of any compost system should be that of a wrung-out sponge,” she says. You can’t let it get too wet or too dry or else the process won’t work properly.\nThe basics are simple, but to ensure you have a happy composting journey we asked our experts for their favorite tips and tricks.\n“Compost is like a magical elixir for any soil ecosystem,” says Louie. It helps plant growth, thanks to its multitude of nutrients and microbes and, thanks to its richness, you canadd compost anywhere there’s soil. Louie recommends adding the final product to your garden, your plants and even trees on the street or at the park.\nIn addition, if your system doesn’t produce lots of compost, such as with a vermicomposter, you can makecompost tea, according to Louie. Just take compost, put it in some water, give it a sugary food and aerate it. It will bubble and become alive, then you can pour it into your soil for a nutritious boost or spray it on your plant’s leaves.\nNow that you know the basics of composting, it’s time to figure out which system to use. To choose which compost method is best for you, Louie says the most important thing to do is figure out exactly what, and how much, you want to compost. “Set your own expectations of what you want to do,” says Louie. “Find a system that realistically matches with your waste stream and the level of effort that you want to put in.”\nIf you have access to outdoor space, you have plenty of options for compost. The first, and what Louie says is the easiest, is what’s calledtrench composting. To trench compost all you need to do is dig a deep hole, toss your food scraps in and cover it with8 to 10 inches of soil.\nA second and similar way is with adigester, which is basically a bin that’s partially underground and partially above ground. The part of the digester that’s below ground has holes so the soil’s ecosystem can break down your food scraps, but its lid on top keeps smells and pests away.\nThere’s some variance in digesters, as some use a design that uses theheat of the sun to help decompositionand others encourage you to add worms. According to Louie, while digesters are able to compost your waste without worms since they’re placed in the ground, adding the little critters can help speed up the process — especially if your soil doesn’t naturally have a lot of worms — but in general they aren’t necessary.\nBoth of these methods require less upkeep than other composting methods because they have access to the actual soil, which helps break down food with less maintenance. If you use a contained system like a vermicomposter or an elevated compost bin you’ll have to keep a closer eye on your ratio to ensure everything is composting smoothly.\nYet another option is a compost bin that sits on top of the ground but still has holes in the bottom to help with drainage. It doesn’t have as much access to the natural soil, but since the bin is aboveground you can get a composter with multiple bins or even two separate ones if you need you to compost more at the same time.\nThis system is similar to the oneGreenfieldprefers, which is an open-air, DIY composter. “The two main ways that I make a compost bin are with pallets that I pick up from going to waste or with hardware cloth/chicken wire,” Greenfield says. “Simply put the three pallets together to make a U shape and then on the front fashion some sort of door to keep dogs out, such as wood slabs, chicken wire or another pallet. Or if you are using the hardware cloth/chicken wire method, use about 10 feet and tie it into a circle. Simple as that!”\nThe last of the outdoor options are elevated, completely above-ground containers that have their own bottom that doesn’t leach into the soil. “The benefit of these is that they can go on your patios, on your rooftop, your balconies,” says Louie. “They can sit on surfaces and contain the composting process entirely within them, but there is usually a little bit more attention that needs to be paid to the balance of browns and greens and what you’re doing in there.”\nLouie says if you’re looking for a tumbler, you should consider a two-chambered one because they help a lot with harvesting. You can harvest one chamber while the other is still composting, which means you don’t have to sit and wait for one pile to completely compost before adding more food scraps.\nIf you want an indoor system, the most common option is a worm bin, also known asvermicomposting, which is a contained ecosystem where “you are sort of like the overlord of thousands of worms and you very carefully feed them portions of food scraps,” says Louie. They live in a bedding of carbon-rich paper or cardboard, eat your food scraps and poop out nutrient- and microbially rich casting.\nPortion control is critical to success when vermicomposting, says Louie. Oftentimes you’ll see statistics that composting worms can eat half their weight in scraps per day, but Louie warns that intake is at a worm’s peak performance, so you should start off slow with just a cup or two of food scraps, depending on how many worms you have. She recommends freezing the scraps, thawing them out again so you can drain the water, then feeding them to your worms. She says you should then wait for the food to be mostly gone before you feed again.\nBokashiis a method that Louie says isn’t actually composting but rather “a process of fermenting organic food waste in an airtight container.” It’s a little different than other methods since normal composting is aerobic, but in short, bokashi uses a specific kind of fish flake to ferment food scraps in an airtight, anaerobic setting. The big difference between bokashi and normal compost is that you’re not done after you toss your food scraps into the bucket. With bokashi, once the waste is fermented you need to bury it in the ground so it can fully decompose. Although it’s a bit more work, Louie says bokashi is a great option because you can decompose all sorts of things that you wouldn’t be able to in normal compost like meat, bones, oils and candy.\nAll Seasons bokashi flakes are available in 1-, 2- and 3-gallon portions so you can stock up on your composting needs. While bokashi flakes are easy to find online, if you want to save some money you canmake your ownif you’re feeling adventurous enough.\nThe last indoor options are countertop machines that rapidly dehydrate and churn your food scraps. They are expensive (thisone from Lomi is $499) and depending on the machine you get, the final product might not actually be compost but rather a shrunken, dried-out version of your food that can then be put into a composter or sprinkled into your garden.\nThe FoodCycler by Vitamix Eco 5 is a powerful machine that rapidly dehydrates and chops up your food scraps. While the end product isn't quite compost, you can use it as a fertilizer when you mix it with soil.\nThe Lomi Bloom is perfect for people who want to compost their scraps in a machine that looks good. Plus, with a more intense \"Grow\" mode, it can even break down compostable plastics, likePela's phone cases.\nThere’s a little bit of debate about what can and cannot be composted, but it really depends on what type of composting you’re doing. “Everything will break down,” Louie says, “but ‘Should it break down in your system?’ is the question.”\nIn general, you can compost basically anything that was once living. “The items you can compost depends on your compost system,” says McKenna. “For my municipal compost system, the following items are accepted: houseplants and flowers, fruits and vegetables, paper towels and tissues, food scraps and coffee filters, grain products, dairy products, meat and bones, and paper soiled with food.”\nSimilarly, Lopez says most food waste is good to throw into your compost. “A short list of typical home composting inputs are fruit and veggie scraps, eggshells, coffee grounds, unbleached paper products, cardboard, newspaper clippings, yard trimmings and old flowers,” she says.\nOther things you might not think to compost? “I would recommend also composting hair and fingernail clippings (both your own and pets),” says Greenfield.\nWhile you can compost a lot, there are definitely things you shouldn’t be throwing in your bin. Be sure to pick out any plastic packaging that might be on your food scraps like rubber bands or those pesky stickers on fruit.\nIn addition, Louie says depending on your system, it’s a good idea to avoid cooked foods, oils, salty materials and meats. This is because they either generate a lot of odor when they decompose, attract predators and pests, or are harmful to the worms and bacteria in your compost.\nYou might also be wondering about certain products you buy that say they are compostable. Before you throw it in your bin, carefully read the label because it might not actually be compostable in your system. “Compostable plastics are designed to decompose in industrial facilities at extremely high temperatures,” Lopez says. “Many paper-based products are often coated in a grease-resistant synthetic liner. Compostable plastics and paper products contain PFAS, a group of ‘forever chemicals’ that never fully break down and contaminate the environment, causing chronic health issues. Only products made from pure wood, bamboo, palm leaf or PLA do not have PFAS.”\nNow that you’re ready to compost, you’ll probably want a few more supplies. Here’s a list of our favorite tools that will help you get the best compost possible.\nThis compost bin can be mounted onto any cabinet or wall so you can save counter space.\nThis option from Package Free also features a charcoal filter in its lid to keep any unwanted smells inside.\nIf you want a stylish compost bin, there’s no better option than this one from Bamboozle.

        "full_news": "Here at CNN Underscored, we love finding andtestingsustainable swapsthat can help reduce waste in your day-to-day life. We’ve already sung the praises ofbidets,Stasher bags,Swedish dishclothsand much more, but our latest love is the humblesilicone baking mat.\nContributing writerKate Bratskeiruses them nearly every day, and they’ve helped her cut aluminum foil and parchment paper out of her life entirely.\nOnce you start using silicone baking mats, you’ll wonder how you ever cooked without them. The mats are available in single packs, two-packs and even three-packs, as well as in multiple sizes and shapes.\nSilicone mats like these are available in various brands, colors, shapes and sizes, but theMMmat Silicone Baking Matsin orange are the very product Bratskeir has been using for the past two years. She stores them folded in half with her cutting boards and would guess that she uses themat leastfive times a week.\nSo, what’s so great about these flimsy little things? Their biggest benefit is that they render single-use tinfoil and parchment paper nearly useless. Before these mats, Bratskeir would tear off a new piece of aluminum foil almost every time I put something in the oven. From leftover pizza to uncooked salmon to cookie dough to veggies drizzled in olive oil, every food would get a fresh sheet of foil to separate it from the baking sheet.\nWhile baking sheets are meant to be cleaned regularly, this isn’t something that happens with reliable certainty in many households. Sheets can be rife with burn stains and sometimes sticky with an oily residue even after a cleanse in the dishwasher. Cooking with the silicone baking mats, which — praise the powers that be — are dishwasher-safe, makes Bratskeir confident that whatever food she’s making will not be contaminated by what’s left on the sheet. Plus, the mats will help keep the baking sheet from getting dirty.\nThe silicone sheets are rated to withstand oven temperatures up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit and are safe in the freezer too. They are truly nonstick and incredibly easy to wipe clean. Some reviewers say they even use the sheets to line their refrigerators — they’d definitely stay in place — to keep everything spotless.\nBuying something new is rarely the best option when it comes to practicing sustainability. But we believe these are worth the purchase because they so drastically cut down the need for single-use sheet liners. They can last for years too. One way to ensure they last is to avoid cutting directly on top of them, since it’d be possible for a sharp knife to slice into the silicone and eventually tear a hole.\nWhile tossing away foil is hardly the biggest environmental offense in many kitchens (and actually,aluminum foil is recyclablein many municipalities if you do it correctly), these reusable sheets are a win in our book when it comes to making small changes to cut down on waste.\nZachary Cartwright, lead food scientist atAQUALAB by Addiumwith a doctorate in food science and a member ofIFT’s food safety and quality management division, gave our team some insight into how to find the best silicone baking mat. If you already have a silicone baking mat but aren’t sure if it’s high quality, he gave us a trick to check before you use it again: “Lower-quality mats may contain plastic fillers that release odors or smoke. Bend the mat, and if you see white streaks, it’s a red flag.” He also told us food-grade silicone should be labeled as BPA-free, LFGC- or FDA-certified. Other features to keep an eye out for are a reinforced mesh core, temperature resistance up to 428 degrees Fahrenheit, and dishwasher-safe and stain-resistant labels.\nThe following FAQs were answered by food scientists Zachary Cartwright and Abbey Thiel.\nCartwright and Thiel noted that silicone baking mats are safe for cooking and baking as long as they are made from food-grade silicone. “This type of silicone has great thermal stability,” Thiel said. “Always make sure the product is made of FDA-approved silicone. This means the silicone is tested for quality and safety, and meets specific regulatory requirements that make it safe to use with food. This type of silicone is made to be heat-resistant, it doesn’t degrade, and it’s is nontoxic, tasteless and odor-free.”\n“Silicone mats are reusable, nonstick and easy to clean,” Cartwright said. “Parchment paper is coated with silicone — convenient [but] not reusable or eco-friendly.” One is not inherently better than the other, but the various mediums for keeping your pans free from mess offer different features. Cartwright said parchment paper is oven-safe to about 420 degrees Fahrenheit, while food-grade silicone baking mats are safe to temperatures of up to 428 degrees Fahrenheit. Some mats are considered safe to use at higher temperatures, such as the MMmat and it’s maximum of 500 degrees Fahrenheit, but he noted that silicone baking mats are not suitable for broiling.\nFor this article, we consulted the following experts to gain their professional insights.\nCNN Underscored has a team of skilled writers and editors with many years of experience testing, researching and recommending products, and they ensure each article is carefully edited and products are properly vetted.

        "full_news": "Editor’s Note:Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN The Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has been a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Jones is co-author of “Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete.” She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia’s 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Readmore opinionon CNN.\nThe ruling earlier this month by a Texas federal judge to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a drug that is used frequently for medication abortions, is very personal for me.\nThat’s because I took mifepristone years ago during a miscarriage, and it saved my life.\nWhen I was prescribed mifepristone, it had not yet taken center stage in America’s abortion wars. I did not have to make a rushed road trip across state lines to get my medicine, unlike many women who need the drug but live in one of the many states that have restricted access to medication abortion or passed near-total bans on abortion.\nI was not forced to set up a secret meet-up with a stranger in order to buy my medicine on the black market, as several women I spoke to recently said they planned to do. Nor did I have toorder mifepristone onlineand find myself navigatingthe many scammerstaking advantage of the current patchwork of state abortion laws in the US.\nRelated articleOpinion: Anti-abortion advocates are using junk science to usurp the will of the American people\nMifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion and the other, misoprostol, was not subject to the ruling by the Texas judge. The two drugs can be administered to someone having a miscarriage, allowing them to terminate the pregnancy when the fetus is not viable.\nIt happened some years ago: After experiencing more than a day of hemorrhaging during the first trimester of my pregnancy, I visited my ob-gyn, who explained after examining me that my blood pressure was dropping rapidly and the heavy bleeding I was experiencing was an unmistakable sign of a miscarriage.\nFor many women, being prescribed mifepristone is part of their routine medical care. Not so in my case: As my doctor explained, I was facing a dire medical emergency. I was grateful for the medication that saved my life.\nMy miscarriage took me by surprise. I had loved being pregnant the first time around, about a decade earlier. And as a healthy woman, I had no reason for fear when I became pregnant again. By the time I was administered mifepristone, I was losing a life that I had already begun to love. And like many other women, despite my level of education or economic status, I could not outrun the statistics that put Black women at higher risk.\nUp to one in four known pregnancieswill end in a miscarriage. And for Black women, the numbers are alarmingly higher. According to an analysis of 4.6 million pregnancies in seven countries, the risk of a miscarriage for Black women is43% higher than for White women.\nRelated articleOpinion: Texas judge's stunning ruling caps extraordinary week\nIn the Black community, women have traditionally been taught to bear their burdens silently — keep your business to yourself — even after something as devastating as pregnancy loss. We are conditioned to do as I did back then, and keep it moving as we try to outrun the long list of statistics that tell us our lives are in danger from every direction, whether it be from health care risks to societal injustices or other stressors.\nDuring my miscarriage, I was a woman who was afraid, hemorrhaging and in excruciating pain, in desperate need of safe, emergency medical care. Thanks to the administration of mifepristone, I was allowed dignity during my miscarriage. It’s what every woman deserves — whether it be facing a potentially life-threatening miscarriage or seeking an abortion.\nI learned from my experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access to whatever medicines and counseling we need to help us heal and that includes mifepristone. What we don’t need is to be criminalized by politicians and punitive reproductive laws that have long been out of step with public opinion. Despite the continuing political attacks on women’s reproductive rights, more than 61% of US adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according toPew Research Center.\nAfter the US Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued atemporary orderto preserve the status quo, ensuring access to the drug while giving the justices more time to study the issue.\nI am hoping the justices can put politics aside and focus on the science surrounding the safety of mifepristone, a drug that, thankfully, I had access to when my life was in danger. Mifepristone, a synthetic steroid, is evensafer thancommon prescription drugs including penicillin and Viagra.\nFollowing the science demands that, regardless of where you stand on the issue of abortion, consideration must be made for cases like mine and the millions of other women who for years havesafely used this medicationfor complications surrounding miscarriages.\nIt must end. And I’m betting that whether it be with our voice or our votes, women will have the last word.",

        "headline": "The 2024 presidential alternative many voters will want",
        "full_news": "Editor’s Note: Joe Lieberman, an independent, is a former US Senator who represented Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. He was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 2000 presidential election. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewmore opinionon CNN.\nWhen Ralph Nader ran for president in 2000, he offered a simple rationale for a bid that would ultimately help“spoil”the election for the Democratic ticket I was privileged to be on with Al Gore. In Nader’s view, the two parties were ideologically indistinguishable.\nThat argument was baseless. There weresignificant differencesinpolicybetween the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney ticket — which ended up victorious, in partthanks to Nader— and ours. For Nader, this wasn’t really about the “two-party duopoly,” as he coined it. This was about hisdesiretopushGore and the Democratic Party to the left.\nToday, of course, no one can reasonably argue that the two parties aren’t ideologically distinct. The core problem in Washington, DC, is that they’re too divided to get much done.\nThough amajorityof Americans long for the era when Republicans and Democrats worked together to find bipartisan solutions to big problems, many members of Congress refuse to work together onimmigration, thedebt ceilingand other issues critical to the nation, even when bipartisanship is the way to restore our common prosperity and security. Indeed, today, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate, bipartisanship is the only way to pass any legislation.\nWhile undoing the divisions plaguing our political system will not be simple, there is one step that can be taken — and it begins with giving voters a real alternative in the 2024 presidential election.\nMost often, when Americans cast their votes for president and vice president, their ballot has only two viable tickets: one nominated by the Democratic Party and the other by the Republican Party. But what would happen if they had a third viable option?\nThe process for adding that third viable option is not only arduous and time-consuming, but itvaries from state to stateand in the District of Columbia.\nOpinion: Don’t count DeSantis out yet; the GOP’s 2024 race is far from over\nToday,No Labels, a nonprofit organization that I co-chair, is laying the groundwork for such a campaign in 2024. Since early 2022, our team has been diligently working across the country to obtain ballot access for a potential No Labels ticket, typically by collecting a certain number of petition signatures from voters in each state.\nIf we are successful, a unity ticket — comprised of one Democrat and one Republican — could be presented to voters right next to the Republican and Democratic nominees.\nWe think of this as an insurance policy for the country — an option to be deployed if, and only if, both of the two major party nominees fail to offer voters a choice of candidates they’d like to vote for or a way out of the partisan divisiveness that now dominates in the nation’s capital. We will be consistently monitoring the sentiment of Americans through our own research and polling, as well as public polling, to make that determination.\nIn this and several other ways, No Labels’ effort could not be more different from the “spoiler” campaign that Nader attempted two decades ago.\nFirst, if No Labels were to lend its ballot lines to a presidential ticket, the presidential candidate would be a Democrat and the vice presidential candidate would be a Republican, or vice versa. As such, it would appeal to some voters who might otherwise have voted for the Democratic ticket, and other voters who might otherwise have voted for the Republican ticket. And it would appeal to still other voters who would not have voted for either.\nOpinion: Why Biden is lying low ahead of 2024\nThese nominees would be selected by a diverse and distinguished group of citizens serving on a committee — and would be ratified by delegates who would gather at the No Labels National Convention planned for April 2024. This convention will occur about six weeks after the March 5th “Super Tuesday” primaries, a day which historically has clarified who the major party nominees will be.\nSecond, No Labels’ 2024 effort is not designed to push the Democratic nominees to the left or Republican candidates to the right. Rather, it’s intended to force one or both parties to appeal to America’s growing commonsense majority. If they don’t, our ballot line will create the opening for a unity ticket that will.\nAccording torecent polling by CNN, the number of individuals who identify as independent is on the rise, now comprising 41% of the electorate — compared to only 28% who described themselves as Democrats and 31% who described themselves as Republicans. These numbers are more evidence that there could be a potential path to victory for an independent ticket in 2024.\nBut if there doesn’t appear to be such a path in the months ahead, No Labels will stand down, focusing instead on the work we have done over the last decade to elect and organize members of the House and Senate who have demonstrated the courage to reach across the aisle — including members of the bipartisanHouse Problem Solvers Caucus.\nIt seems the Biden administration already may be beginning to recognize the imperative of appealing to the commonsense majority. President Joe Bidenrecently signed into lawa Republican measure to strike down a Washington, DC, crime bill reducing penalties for those who commit violent crimes, and he announced more stringentborder controlpolicies.\nOur hope is that the Republicans jockeying for their party’s nomination will similarly see the need to reach out beyond their base instead of appealing todivisivepolicies and politics.\nIn the end, No Labels hopesnotto have to offer our ballot line to an independent unity ticket. We want the parties to come to their senses. But judging from the angry and apocalypticreactionsof strategists in both parties at the thought of No Labels’ insurance policy, it is clear that party leaders now know that there could be a political cost to ignoring the commonsense majority. And that’s a reason to hope for a better future for our government and our country.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Viewmore opinionon CNN.\nOn Monday, the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee — chaired by Donald Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan — is set to holda field hearingin New York City called “Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan.”A statementbills the hearing as an examination of how, the Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s policies have “led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.”\nIn response, Bragg’s office slammed Jordan’s hearing as “a political stunt” while noting that data released by the New York Police Department shows crime is down in Manhattan with respect to murders, burglaries, robberies and more through April 2, compared with the same period last year.\nIn reality, this Jordan-led hearing isn’t about stopping crime but about defending Trump — who was recently charged by a Manhattan grand jury with34 felonies. Trump pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from an investigation into a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. The former president also is facing criminal probes in other jurisdictionsover efforts to overturn the 2020 electionandhis handling of classified documentsat Mar-a-Lago.\nBragg sued Jordanand his committee last week in federal court, accusing the Judiciary Committee chairman of a “transparent campaign to intimidate and attack” his office for its investigation and prosecution of Trumpby making demandsfor confidential documents and testimony.\nWhile Jordan and his committee appear focused ondiscrediting the investigationinto Trump, why aren’t they looking into two recentbombshell reportsby ProPublica that raised red flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After all, the House Judiciary Committee’swebsiteexplains that it has jurisdiction over “matters relating to the administration of justice in federal courts” – for which the revelations concerning Thomas fit perfectly.\nRelated articleThe Clarence Thomas revelations are the last straw. It's time for Congress to act\nFirst, we learned in early April that Crow had provided Thomas and his wife, Ginni, for decades withluxurious vacationsincluding on thedonor’s yacht and private jetto faraway places such as Indonesia and New Zealand. That information was never revealed to the public. (In a rare public statement,Thomas respondedhe was advised at the time that he did not have to report the trips. The justice said the guidelines for reporting personal hospitalityhave changed recently. “And, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future,” he said.)\nThen on Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomasfailed to disclosea 2014 real estate deal involving the sale of three properties he and his family owned in Savannah, Georgia, to that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One of Crow’s companies made the purchases for $133,363, according to ProPublica.A federal disclosure lawpassed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices and other officials to make public the details of most real estate sales over $1,000.\nAsProPublicadetailed, the federal disclosure form Thomas filed for that year included a space to report the identity of the buyer in any private transaction, but Thomas left that space blank. Fourethics law experts told ProPublicathat Thomas’ failure to report it appears to be a violation of the law. (Thomas did not respond to questions from ProPublica on its report; CNN reached out to the Supreme Court and Thomas for comment.)\nRelated articleThomas revelation of gifts fits a broader pattern of financial nondisclosure from the Supreme Court\nThe House Judiciary Committee has long addressed issues such as those surrounding Thomas. In fact, the committee is where investigations andthe impeachmentof federal judges often commence.\nOne recent example came in 2010 with JudgeG. Thomas Porteous Jr., whom the committee investigated and recommended for impeachment.\nThe committee’s Task Force on Judicial Impeachmentsaid evidence showed Porteous “intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury, engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme, solicited and accepted unlawful gifts, and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings.” The Senate laterfound Porteous guiltyoffour articles of impeachmentand removed him from the bench.\nIn contrast with the House panel, the Senate Judiciary Committee — headed by Democrats —announcedin the wake of the reporting on Thomas that it plans to hold a hearing “on the need to restore confidence in the Supreme Court’s ethical standards.” Beyond that, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgiasent a letter Friday callingfor a referral of Thomas to the US attorney general over “potential violations of the Ethics in Government Act 1978.”\nThe House Judiciary Committee’s websitenotes, “The Committee on the Judiciary has been called the lawyer for the House of Representatives.” Under Jordan that description needs to be updated to state that the Committee on the Judiciary is now “the lawyer for Donald J. Trump.” And the worst part is that the taxpayers are the ones paying for Jordan’s work on Trump’s behalf.",

        "headline": "Top secrets come spilling out",
        "full_news": "In 1917, British analysts deciphered a coded message the German foreign minister sent to one of his country’s diplomats vowing to begin “unrestricted submarine warfare” and seeking to win over Mexico with a promise to “reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona” if the US entered the world war. When it became public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the conflict against Germany.\n“Never before or since has so much turned upon the solution of a secret message,” wrote David Kahn in his classic 1967 history of secret communications, “The Codebreakers.” The Germans had taken great pains to keep their intentions confidential, and the codebreakers in London’s“Room 40”had to do a lot of work to decipher the telegram.\nTheir efforts stand in stark contrast to the ease with which secrets came tumbling out of a Pentagon intelligence network when 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard cyber specialist Jack Teixeira allegedly posted hundreds of documents on a Discord chatroom known as “Thug Shaker Central.” The disclosures likely won’t start a war, but they could prove extremely damaging to the US and several of its allies, including Ukraine.\nTeixeira is one ofmore than one million peoplewho have Top Secret clearance. “The Pentagon has already started taking steps to limit the number of people who have access to such sensitive information,” wroteBrett Bruen, a former US diplomat and Obama administration official. “But much more can be done. … Why do so many people, especially those working short stints in government,have access to information that can shape the fate of nations and their leaders?”\nWriting in the Financial Times,Kori Schakesaw “some good news.”\n“While specific details will be incredibly valuable to Russia and other adversaries, these are not bombshell revelations: journalists had already reported Ukrainian ammunition running low; peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv were never likely; allies have long been aware that the US eavesdrops on them; and the disparaging assessment of Ukraine’s forthcoming offensive may prove no more accurate than previous predictions were.” These will not prove as damaging as theEdward SnowdenandChelsea Manningdisclosures.\nBut, she warned, “Technology making data ever more portable, distribution more global and communications more bespokewill make it easier to amass information and distribute it— either privately or publicly.”\nIn less than a week, the two Democrats expelled from the Tennessee House for their participation in a gun control protest were sent back to office by local officials.\nWriting for CNN Opinion, Rep.Justin Pearsonnoted, “This should be a chastening moment for revanchist forces in Tennessee’s legislature and across the country. Over the long haul, the undemocratic machinations employed to oust us from office are destined to fail. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. Events this week demonstrated, more than ever, that this is indeed the case…”\n“Over two-thirds of Americans — including four out of 10 Republicans — support the kind of common sense gun safety laws that Rep. Jones, Rep. Johnson and I were protesting in favor of, in the wake of the senseless March 27 Covenant School massacre.”\n“And yet,calls for common sense gun reform measures fall on deaf ears in our legislaturewhere a Republican supermajority is wildly out of step with most people’s values.”\nThe politics of gun control have shifted, argued Democratic strategistMax Burns. The NRA’s internal struggles have weakened its influence while Democrats in office, who once feared touching the issue of guns, are increasingly speaking out. And they are making some progress in enacting new state laws, Burns noted.\n“Biden and the Democrats have the rare opportunity to buildyet another winning coalition out of an issue once viewed as political poison.”\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court issued an order that temporarily ensured access to a key drug used in many medication abortions. The move gave the justices more time to consider the issue after a Texas federal judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion pill 23 years ago.\n“If abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill — reportedly used in more than half of abortions in the United States — will be severely undercut,” wroteMichele GoodwinandMary Ziegler.\n“Beyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions don’t like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists areusing junk science to bypass the will of the American public and restrict abortion…”\n“There are no grounds for challenging mifepristone’s approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review — more than four years — before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use than Viagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident in Europe.”\nIn 1986, Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow bureau chief for US News & World Report, was seized by Soviet authorities and locked up in Lefortovo prison. He was the last American journalist to be arrested in Russia before last month’s detention of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich, who like Daniloff, speaks Russian fluently. Gershkovich has been charged with espionage but US officials have concluded that he was “wrongfully detained.”\nAsDavid A. Andelmannoted, Daniloff’s detention in prison lasted for 13 days before he was put under house arrest and then eventually swapped for an accused Soviet spy. In a conversation with Andelman, Daniloff recalled his reaction when he was imprisoned. “I felt claustrophobic, and I felt like I wanted to get out of there immediately. Of course, there was no chance of that. The door slams, and you have all these thoughts and feelings that run through you, andthen you settle down and you realize you’re going to be hanging around that cell for some time.”\nGershkovich’s family in Philadelphia received a letter, handwritten in Russian, from the reporter Friday.\n“I want to say thatI am not losing hope,” he noted. “I read. I exercise. And I am trying to write. Maybe, finally, I am going to write something good.”\nThe Amazon series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” returns this month for its fifth and final season — andDavid Perryis here for it. The series brings back memories of visiting his grandparents Irma and Mordy in their “tiny rent-controlled Greenwich Village apartment,” an experience that helped shape his Jewish identity.\n“As a Jewish historian,” Perry wrote, “I worry about the tension between preserving the memory of past hardships while not locking our entire history into a tale of oppression. The moments of peace and joy are as vital as the moments of violence. In fact, it’s the periods of peace, of success, of interfaith community, that reveal the terrible truth about the violence: it wasn’t inevitable. People could have made different choices…”\n“A show like ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’lets me revel in my personal New York Jewish heritage while also getting a little break from all the worry. It’s a warm, funny, sexy, extremely Jewish …. comedy that hits me straight in my glossy childhood memories. That isn’t to say the show isn’t also problematic — it most certainly is.”\nIn the latest installment of CNN Opinion’s “Little Kids, Big Questions” series, 10-year-old Ronan wonders if animals are capable of being smarter than humans. With the help of the John Templeton Foundation, which is partnering on the project, the answer came fromJane Goodall, world renowned for her work with chimpanzees.\n“One of the attributes of intelligence is the ability to think and solve problems. In the early 1960s, I was told that this was unique to humans, and only we could use and make tools, only we had language and culture,” Goodall said. “But more and more research has proved that many animals are excellent at solving problems. Many use tools, and many show cultural differences. Some scientists believe that whales and dolphins are communicating with what may be a real language.”\n“Although the difference between humans and other animals is simply one of degree, our intellect really is amazing. …bees can count and do math, and that just shows how much we still have to learn about animal intelligence.But humans can calculate the distance to the stars.”\nEarlier this month, a Texas jury convicted Daniel Perry of murder for fatally shooting a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020. The jury deliberated for 17 hours and decided Perry’s action couldn’t be excused under the state’s “stand your ground” law. Prosecutors argued Perry had instigated the incident and they introduced into evidence messages that suggested the shooting was not a spur-of-the-moment act but a premeditated one.\nOn the evening of the jury verdict, Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticized the decision and told viewers he had invited Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the show to ask if he would consider pardoning Perry. Others on the right called for Abbott to issue a pardon, and the governor soon responded with an announcement that he would do just that, as long as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended that Perry should be granted one.\n“Trial verdicts are determined by judges and juries,” wroteDean Obeidallah. “What Abbott is doing is not just wrong, it’s dangerous.His pardon, when it comes, is not what the rule of law looks like.”\nTwo of the likeliest candidates for president in 2024 haven’t officially committed yet.\nPresident Joe Biden says he intends to run again but has delayed making a formal announcement. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is making all the moves a presidential contender usually makes, including hawking his new book and visiting New Hampshire, but he hasn’t joined fellow Republicans including former President Donald Trump, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson in declaring.\n“DeSantis, who was neck and neck with the former president just a few months ago, may have lost a step or two in more recent polling. But his track record of successful governance in Florida shouldforce GOP voters to think long and hard about what version of their party they want to put forward,” observedPatrick T. Brown.\n“A third Trump presidential nomination would indicate that Republican primary voters may prefer style over substance. But if they are serious about not just making liberals mad but advancing actual policy, GOP voters should consider other names, starting with the Florida governor.”\nEven without an official announcement by the president, wroteJulian Zelizer, the Biden-Harris campaign is very much under way. “By choosing to lie low while Republicans are gearing up for 2024, Biden is employing his version of what has become known as the ‘Rose Garden Strategy,’ whereby the incumbent campaigns by focusing on the business of being president and showing voters that he is the responsible figure in the race.”\n“The president’s understated strategy makes room for Republicans to stoke chaos, tear each other apart and make unforced errors while he remains above the fray for as long as possible. This strategy makes the GOP the focus of the election, allowing Biden to reinforce his message from 2020:do voters want someone who will govern and act in a serious manner or do they want a circus?”\nGene Seymour:I am betting on Cousin Greg.

        "headline": "How did Sudan go from casting off despotic rule to this?",
        "full_news": "Editor’s Note:Justin Lynch is a researcher and analyst in Washington, DC. He is co-author of the book “Sudan’s Unfinished Democracy.” The views expressed here are his own. Readmore opinionat CNN.\nFour years ago, almost to the day, the people of Sudan were celebrating a revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Now the East African country facesthe possibility of a complete collapsesimilar to the chaos we see today in Yemen or Libya.\nOn Saturday, rival military factions began fighting each other in the capital of Khartoum. The two sides battled for control of the nation’s airports, bases and military compounds. Violence quickly spilled into the streets and across the country.\nSome 45 million Sudanese effectively are held hostage and are unable to venture out of their homes for fear of being killed in the crossfire.At least 180 peoplehave perished in the fighting, including threeWorld Food Programmehumanitarian workers.\nThe conflict pits two bitter rivals and their powerful armed forces against each other. On one side are the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. On the other side are the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti.\nThere is no good side in this conflict. Both have been accused of a long litany of human rights violations.\nHow did Sudan go from casting off despotic rule and creating a fledgling democracy a few years ago to teetering on the brink of state collapse?\nOn April 11, 2019, Sudan’s longtime dictator, Bashir,was overthrown. The cause of Bashir’s removal was months of protests led by Sudan’s unions, which spurred a military coup from the SAF and RSF. Both Burhan and Hemeti joined forces to remove their former boss.\nRelated articleRival generals battle for control in Sudan. Here's a guide to the fighting\nIt was a moment of promise because there was hope for democracy. I remember walking around the “sit-in” — a giant carnival of freedom in the middle of Khartoum that protesters had blocked off to demand change. It was electric.\nBut social movements such as the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) — the union behind the protest — often struggle to translate the momentum of their demonstrations into real political power.\nThe reason for this is, in part, structural. Social movements such as the SPA are often based on grassroots activism. A dictator can arrest one or two leaders of an organization but not an entire country.\nHowever, once a dictator is overthrown, these kinds of social movements often struggle to build the leadership hierarchy necessary during political negotiations that take place. Like many other movements, Sudan’s protesters were unable to translate mobilization into political power.\nRelated articleAfter a lifetime spent in war zones, this is what stays with me above all else\nCivilian leaders entered into a negotiation with the military over the future of the country shortly after Bashir fell in April 2019. The two sides were not evenly matched. Because of these leadership challenges, the pro-democracy forces struggled to bargain with the disciplined military.\nAny momentum that pro-democracy advocates had during the negotiations was stamped out in June 2019 when RSF soldiersviolently dispersedthe sit-in. More than 100 people were killed.\nAfter the June massacre and the leadership challenges,a transitional constitutionwas signed in August 2019 that gave the SAF and RSF most of the power in Sudan. Burhan was the head of state, and Hemeti was placed in an elevated political position. Elections were promised in 2022, but few believed they would actually happen.\nThe transitional period began in August 2019, and I interviewedAbdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister, several times for a book that I co-wrote on Sudan’s revolution. The way that the constitution was written meant that Hamdok had limited power as the prime minister. Burhan was the head of state and wanted to preserve the powers of the SAF.\nHamdok often told me that revolutions come in cycles. The 2019 removal of Bashir was a high point of revolution, and he saw his job as making as many reforms as possible before the low tide of counterrevolution swept him away.\nHamdok found that the legacy of 30 years of dictatorship meant that Sudan’s political and economic models were dilapidated. But Burhan and Hemeti blocked the big reforms that Hamdok wanted to make.\nRelated articleDarfur's return to war would spell disaster for Sudan\nOutside Khartoum violence grew. Parts of Sudan such as Darfur saw a new round of conflict between ethnic groups orchestrated by RSF troops. More than 430,000 peoplewere displaceddue to conflict in Sudan, mostly in Darfur.\nSoldiers did not hide the atrocities they committed against civilians. I remember drinking tea with a soldier aligned with the RSF at his house in Darfur as he explained why he had recently participated in the burning down of a village from another ethnic group.\nThe soldier reasoned that a member of his tribe had been killed in an altercation, so the RSF-aligned forces took revenge by torching a village that had been home to30,000 people. At least163 people died.\nTensions between the SAF and RSF grew. Burhan viewed Hemeti and his RSF forces as upstart usurpers from Darfur who were undisciplined. Hemeti on the other hand believed that it was time for Darfur to lead Sudan.\nHamdok was on the cusp of beginning to turn the economy around when Burhan and the SAF intervened. As we wrote in the book “Sudan’s Unfinished Democracy,” the potential success of a civilian government was too much for Burhan. In October 2021,Hamdok was removedin a military coup.\nAfter the October 2021 coup, the United States and United Nations pushed a worse version of the transitional constitution in Sudan.They arguedthat it was the best way to bring democracy.\nThe idea was to restart the transitional period, but I and many others argued it was shortsighted andwouldn’t work. Returning to a government led by Burhan was clearlynot going to usherin democracy. If the plan ended in a coup the first time, why would it work the second time?\nRelated articleHow the battle for Bakhmut exposed Russia's 'meat-grinder'\nSome activists stopped partnering with the US and came to see the UN mission asa roadblock to democracybecause of these policies. I felt sorry when I spoke with the best American and foreign diplomats, who also understood the international policy in Sudan wouldn’t work. They saw the flaws but felt powerless to dissent and were forced to carry out decisions made many levels above them.\nWhat preceded this weekend’s outbreak of clashes wasa controversial partof the international policy that tried to unify the SAF and RSF. The idea was to make a single army, but neither Hemeti nor Burhan wanted to give up the power they had amassed.\nThe plan to unify the military hadn’t worked in similar contexts. It wasa repeatof the 2013 and 2016 unification processes that took place in South Sudan with similarly bloody results. Instead, the tenuous relationship between Burhan and Hemeti boiled over due to the pressure.\nIt can be easy to look at the recent history of “revolutions” in countries such as Myanmar, Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan and conclude that they eventually backfire. I don’t agree. I learned from Sudanese activists that a nation’s political fortune is an active battle.\nWe can one day hope that Sudan sees dreams of democracy come true. But right now, the Sudanese people are just hoping to survive the day.\nThe lesson from Sudan is that a revolution is only the start of change, not the end.",

        "headline": "Recap: 'Succession' finds dark humor in the aftershocks",
        "full_news": "Editor’s Note:The following contains major spoilers about the fourth episode of “Succession’s” fourth season, “Honeymoon States.”\nAfter the shockcame the aftershocks, the power vacuum, and perhaps most significantly and impressively, the laughs, as “Succession” pivoted to face life after Logan Roy, in an episode that finally put the HBO show’s title into full flower.\nAt the same time, they mourned the larger-than-life figure they had lost, taking into account that he had treated many of them abysmally. And the fourth hour also marked the return of Logan’s wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass), in what felt like “Marcia Strikes Back,” while his current and much younger girlfriend, Kerri (Zoe Winter), was bluntly shown the door. (The latter evoked memories of the musical “Evita,” when the title character boots Peron’s mistress, who sings about another suitcase in another hall.)\nMore than anything, the episode underscored just how brutally funny “Succession” can be, with Shiv (Sarah Snook) reading her father’s obituary and musing, “Dad sounds amazing. I would like to have met dad,” while brothers Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) hilariously translated the language, with references to Logan having been “a man of his time” equaling “racist.”\nThe episode also showcased the executivesat Waystar Royco, who uncomfortably wondered what to do with a document that included not only Logan’s posthumous wishes but hand-written notes that seemingly specified who he wished to succeed him. They joked, feebly, about tossing the paper in the toilet, while making very clear how much they really wanted to toss the paper in the toilet.\nAll the knives came out, with Carl (David Rasche) brutally insulting Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), scarcely hiding behind the fact that he was presenting the doubts about Tom’s future as a hypothetical.\nAmid that, though, there were also human moments, with the tortured Kendall articulating his conflicted feelings to Waystar executive Frank (Peter Friedman) by saying, “He made me hate him, and he died. I feel like he didn’t like me. I disappointed him.”\n“Succession” also underscored the fragility of not just life, but a corporate legacy, with the public-relations folk discussing how to spin and diminish Logan’s involvement in his later years as a means of bucking up the company and its stock price – a maneuver that Kendall ultimately and surreptitiously approved, concluding that it was the sort of smart and ruthless move that his father would have executed.\nQuestions of succession also appear to be threatening the harmony achieved by Kendall, Shiv and Roman prior to Logan’s exit, with Shiv being left as the odd woman out in a plan to fill the CEO seat just long enough to close the sale to GoJo. Trust doesn’t come easily in series creator Jesse Armstrong’s world, and when Shiv said, “I need to wet my beak,” the assurances from her brothers clearly left the impression how easily that beak could wind up bent out of joint.\nUltimately, after the operating highs of the previous episode, the series successfully turned the page from grieving to the next order of business. And that too, as Kendall put it regarding Logan and the “bad dad” PR leaks, is “what he would do.”",

        "headline": "'Yellowjackets' leans hard into '90s music nostalgia, and we're here for it",
        "full_news": "Of the many dark gifts Showtime’s eerie hit series “Yellowjackets” serves up for us, the juiciest this season is by far the music.\nIn Sunday’s episode of “Yellowjackets,” alt-rock queenAlanis Morissettewill debut a version of the show’s theme song, “No Return,” and has already released it as a single.\nOne of the most unexpected and successful uses of throwback music came in the first episode of Season 2 last month, when Warren Kole’s Jeff had a moment to himself in the car after an intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) – during which he rocks out hard to Papa Roach’s “Last Resort” (sure, the track actually came out in 2000, but that doesn’t take away from its retro vibe).\nIn an interview with CNN, the show’s music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that the Papa Roach song selection was scripted, and “served as a perfect physical outlet for Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone in his garage.”\nOther standout moments in the script, however, are hers to interpret, and Felder relishes the opportunity to match those moments with the right songs from the period.\nCase in point, from the same episode – the placement of Amos’s signature track “Cornflake Girl,” off her groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album “Under the Pink.”\nThe song – which appropriately has the lyric “Things are getting kind of gross” just as teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) is about to ingest something unthinkable – “came to mind pretty quickly as a possibility” to Felder.\n“I felt that Amos’s lyrics could serve as a befitting launchpad for the first episode’s ending – not only as a reflection of Young Shauna’s state of mind,” she noted, “but also as a reflection of the past and present moods and mentalities lived out by the other ‘Yellowjackets’ characters in Season 2.”\nFelder’s work is challenging, in the sense that there is often an ideal wish-list selection for a song during a certain moment in each script, which then might change either due to something technical or because the needs of the scene evolve during production, as a result of many elements, including the actors’ performances.\n“Everyone on the team always wants the best song-select possible to enhance the story,” she said. “When we get to post (production), the common question that comes up among us during the collaboration process is simply, ‘Do we think we can beat this?’”\nDuring that collaborative process, Felder says she doesn’t “believe there is an exact roadmap into how to merge songs with any given scene or story.”\n“I always say, ‘Let the picture tell you what it needs.’ (Kind of like the Wilderness I guess?)”\n“The song seems to refer to those unspeakable monsters that can live in one’s head,” Felder noted, referencing the strange collective hallucinations the group undergoes while cannibalizing one of their own. “I can’t think of a more perfect way to hauntingly accent (that) scene, a.k.a. ‘the feast.’”\nTo drive home just how important music is to the specific ambient feel of “Yellowjackets,” one need look no further than the super creepySeason 2 trailerfor the show, which features Florence + The Machine’s exceptional and haunting rendition of No Doubt’s timeless 1995 hit, “Just A Girl.”\n“We tried to really add some horror elements to this iconic song to fit the tone of the show. And as someone who’s first musical love was pop punk and Gwen Stefani, it was a dream job.”\nOf her collaboration with “Yellowjackets,” Morrisette, too, felt inspired by the show.\n“I see parallels between ‘Yellowjackets’ and my perspective while songwriting: the sheer intensity, that going for the jugular with no fear around going for the profane,” Morissette said in a statement. “I’ve strived my entire career to support the empowerment of women and sensitives, and see the world through the female lens, and what’s so wonderful about this show is that each character is allowed to be dynamic and complex as opposed to oversimplified, reduced versions of women. I feel honoured to be a part of the legacy of ‘Yellowjackets.’”",

        "full_news": "“Barry” has taken chances from the very beginning, which is certainly true of a fourth and final season that picks up wherethe third left off, with its hitman-turned-wannabe actor getting arrested. That paves the way for an even darker season that accentuates the show’s ensemble aspect while leaning a little too heavily on blurring lines with flights of fancy.\nThanks to“Succession,”“Barry” won’t be the highest-profile goodbye on HBO this spring, but the Emmy-nominated series isn’t chopped liver either. It’s fair to say, in fact, that while these episodes don’t quite measure up to what’s gone before, even a less-lethal “Barry” is still very, very good.\nBill Hader’s auteur turnas director-producer-star remains one of TV’s most unpredictable series, and the new season has a strong“Better Call Saul”vibe to it, triggered by fallout from the seemingly inevitable fact that Hader’s Barry couldn’t maintain his double life forever.\n“Barry” has always wrestled with the discomfort of having a protagonist who murders people, and the question of empathizing with its namesake becomes particularly acute in these episodes with the character in prison. When Barry asks, “Are you mad at me?” with an almost-childlike naivete, it’s easy to forget, at least momentarily, some of the horrible things he’s done, even if the revenge-minded Jim Moss (Robert Wisdom) can’t.\nHader (who directed every episode) also excels at darkly comic visual gags, which are augmented in the new season with a few hysterical cameos by actual Hollywood figures, among them director Guillermo del Toro, made even funnier by how random they seem to be.\nThat said, the show’s surreal digressions and detours into fantasy become more distracting, in a way that feels a little too precious at times. The saving grace, consistently, is the strength of the cast, even if prison creates impediments to their interactions.\nHBO made most but not all of the season available, and the series effectively keeps the audience on edge and guessing about where it will all end up, and how (or if) its various threads will connect.\nThe likelihood of a happy ending for everyone in “Barry”-land never seemed to be in the cards, but Hader and co-creator Alec Berg appear determined to exit on their own terms, as good (mostly) and sporadically frustrating as that might be. That’s why it’s hard to get mad at a show that takes such bracing creative risks, even with a season that isn’t quite the stone-cold killer that it has been.\n“Barry” begins its fourth and final season April 14 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.",

We all recall with great pride all the heroes who laid down their lives during our War of Liberation.

They tied the knot in 2016, a year after the German footballer had joined United. German outlet Bild have reported that Ivanovic, 38, filed for divorce in November at the Munich District Court.\n\nThe former tennis star is also believed to have filed for child support in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. She lives in the Spanish city with their three sons, Luka, Leon and Teo. Representative for Ivanovic, Christian Schertz, revealed in July that the couple had split because of \"irreconcilable differences\".\n\nIn June, reports in Germany emerged that Schweinsteiger had been spotted kissing an alleged new girlfriend. The German press named the woman as \"Silva\" who is thought to be Bulgarian. Bild even claimed that the two had begun an affair back in the summer of 2024.\n\nMagazine Bunte reported that Ivanovic was open to forgiving Schweinsteiger but it did not happen as he stated he wanted to \"live freely\".

        "full_news": "Bangladesh is preparing to reduce taxes on legally imported mobile phones as part of a broader effort to stabilise handset prices and strengthen regulation ahead of the launch of the National Equipment Identity Register (NEIR) on December 16, according to the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology.\n\nThe decision was made at a meeting on December 1 involving the National Board of Revenue (NBR), the Ministry of Commerce, the Posts and Telecommunications Division and the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC).\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, the government is working to lower the current import duty of about 61 percent to encourage legal imports and bring down retail prices. The government is also considering adjustments to VAT and taxes applied to locally assembled devices, with ministries working to ensure that any reduction in import duties does not disadvantage the country's 13 to 14 domestic manufacturing plants, which rely on foreign investment.\n\nThe meeting also addressed rules affecting expatriate Bangladeshis travelling home. Those with BMET registration cards will be permitted to bring in three mobile phones without tax, while other travellers may bring two. Visitors will be allowed to use their own smartphones without registration for up to 60 days, after which devices must be registered.\n\nOfficials encouraged travellers to carry valid purchase documents to prevent their devices from being used in smuggling networks operating across regional airports like Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Middle East.\n\nTraders holding stockpiled devices imported without duty but carrying valid IMEI numbers will be able to regularise them at a reduced tax rate before December 16, following discussions between BTRC and the revenue authorities. However, this concession will not apply to cloned or refurbished phones.\n\nNo active handset will be disconnected before the NEIR system goes live on 16 December, officials said, urging the public not to be misled by rumours of sudden shutdowns. Authorities also reminded mobile users to check that SIM cards registered in their names are not being used for cybercrime, online gambling or mobile banking fraud, and advised consumers to avoid buying handsets that lack legally issued IMEI numbers.\n\nOfficials said the NEIR rollout will help curb dumping of old and repurposed phones into the country, as well as the longstanding practice of replacing casings to disguise electronic waste as new devices. Customs inspections are being stepped up at airports and land ports handling flights from India, Thailand and China.\n\nThe upcoming Telecommunications Act 2025 includes new data protection measures for eKYC and IMEI registration, introducing penalties for misuse of registration data.\n\nRegarding the implementation of tax reduction, NBR Chairman Md Abdur Rahman Khan told The Daily Star, \"We will make decisions based on the broader national interest. We are not saying that duties will be reduced immediately, but the matter is under consideration.\"\n\nRead moreHow to check if your mobile is illegal or not",

He's one of the reasons Broadway feels so special to me.\"\n\nFelton is currently starring as Draco Malfoy in the Broadway production of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", now in its seventh year in New York. The play, centred on the next generation of Hogwarts families, continues to draw huge crowds and recently set a box office record with more than $3 million earned over Thanksgiving week.\n\nRadcliffe has yet to watch Felton's performance but said on GMA: \"It's really lovely that he's doing Broadway.

Beijing has not confirmed details from that meeting, including any vows to purchase sizable volumes of US soy.\n\nUS Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said last month that the Trump administration expects to meet with China by this week.

        "headline": "A warning for our health system",
        "full_news": "The latest Health and Morbidity Status Survey 2025gives a stark warningabout the nation's health. According to the survey, hypertension now affects 78 out of every 1,000 people, making it the most prevalent disease in the country. Not far behind are peptic ulcers (64 per 1,000) and diabetes (43 per 1,000). These chronic conditions require consistent monitoring, reliable diagnostics, and long-term treatment. Their rising prevalence points to a population increasingly burdened by non-communicable diseases at a scale our current health system is not prepared to manage.\n\nThe survey covered 1.9 lakh people from 47,040 households between November and December last year, and found that one-third of respondents experienced some form of illness in the 90 days preceding the study. Another troubling finding is that 51.2 percent of respondents relied on self-treatment or local pharmacies, while around 20 percent sought private healthcare, and only 11 percent went to government facilities. Such high dependence on informal care reflects a severe lack of accessibility to public healthcare. It also fuels antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as antibiotics—often dispensed without proper diagnosis—are frequently misused. Experts warn that AMR is no longer a distant threat; it is a growing reality, making common infections harder and more expensive to treat.\n\nAnother finding deserving the government's attention is the higher illness rates among women, both young and elderly, compared to men. Moreover, the persistent burden of out-of-pocket expenditure on the population, which averaged Tk 2,487 in the three months preceding the survey, is another serious concern. Such high healthcare costs are crippling for low- and middle-income families. The alarming trends underscore the urgency of health sector reforms.\n\nThe Health Sector Reform Commission had already made crucial recommendations with urgency to address the challenges exposed by the survey. It is, however, concerning that out of its 33 key reform proposals, the government hashalted implementations of 15following the Cabinet Division review. Notably, the excluded recommendations include VAT and tax exemptions on essential antibiotics and medicines for cancer, diabetes, and hypertension, along with proposals for a permanent health commission and a separate public service commission for doctor recruitment. Pushing back these reforms at a time when our health sector is already facing major challenges such as inadequate funding, a shortage of health workers, unequal access to services, and weak governance is most unfortunate.\n\nWe urge the government not to downplay the issues plaguing our health sector and to urgently implement the reforms to make healthcare delivery pro-people.",

We are standing before a very important election. There are several other dimensions to this election,\" the election commissioner said while speaking as the chief guest at the inaugural session of a daylong journalist training programme this morning.\n\nHe said, \"Bangladesh's electoral system has been severely damaged. We are trying to repair this damaged system and restore it to the proper state.\"\n\n\"We are also trying to reorganise and restructure it. However, this work can't be implemented by the commission alone. Cooperation from all stakeholders in the election will be needed,\"\n\nSanaullah said this time there will be two votes, so everyone needs to be a bit more sensitive about time.\n\n\"In the mock voting, it was seen that a voter is taking an average of 3 minutes 52 seconds. Those who vote without reading the ballot are taking 2 minutes. And those who read the ballot before voting are taking 7–8 minutes. We know this reality. The number of centres will not increase, nor will the number of booths. We need to make our voting management smarter,\" he said.\n\nHe said, \"We are introducing a QR code system so that fake journalists cannot enter anywhere using cards.\"\n\nAt the event, EC Senior Secretary Akhtar Ahmed said, \"The arrangements for the election and the referendum ahead of us are huge undertakings, and one complements the other. Many people have questions about the referendum having only one answer for its four questions.\"\n\nHe added, \"During discussions in the advisory council, it was said that political parties usually have 20 points in their manifestos. Not everyone agrees with all of them, but people consider the overall picture. The referendum is similar -- you will cast your vote considering the entire package. We are now in the tide of the election. Everyone wants the best election of the century.\"",

He plays fast bowling really nicely so if he gets an opportunity I'm sure he'll do really well for us.\"\n\nAustralia have won 12 out of the 13 pink ball Tests they have hosted, with their sole loss coming against West Indies at the Gabba in January, 2024. Day-night Tests use a pink ball instead of the usual red one because it is easier to see under the lights.\n\nBatting can be hard during the twilight and evening sessions when the pink ball tends to swing the most but Smith said Brisbane's relatively hard wicket compared to the spongier surface at Adelaide Oval, the usual venue for day-night Tests, could offer something for batters.\n\n\"At times (the ball) can get a little bit soft and you can see guys batting comfortably, I suppose, at stages,\" said Smith.\n\n\"That's one thing we have to weigh up going into this game and see how it plays out.\"\n\nAustralia lead the five-Test series 1-0 following their win in two days in Perth.",

        "headline": "Bay of Bengal’s slow death threatens our future",
        "full_news": "Bangladesh woke up this week to one of the most alarming environmental findings in its recent history. According to a report inThe Daily Star,marine fish populations inside the country's exclusive economic zone in the Bay of Bengal have plummeted at a rate scientists describe as catastrophic. In just seven years, nearly four-fifths of the bay's fish that live in the pelagic zone—neither close to the sea-bed nor the shore—have vanished. This is not a routine decline. It is a collapse—rapid, severe, and potentially irreversible.\n\nTo grasp the magnitude of this collapse, consider that global fisheries scientists sound alarms when stocks fall by 30 to 40 percent. A 50 percent decline signals a crisis. But an80 percent dropin less than a decade suggests a system on the edge of ecological failure. Collapses of this speed and scale have devastated fisheries in Canada's Newfoundland, the United States's California, and Peru in South America—regions where recovery took decades and, in some cases, never fully occurred. Bangladesh is now facing a similar possibility, and the consequences will be far-reaching if urgent action is not taken.\n\nThe news report attributes the collapse to several causes: overfishing, illegal fishing, and destructive fishing practices. These represent real, daily patterns of exploitation that have pushed the bay to exhaustion. Industrial trawlers—both legal and illegal—scrape the seabed with gear that destroys marine habitats, kills juvenile fish, and leaves entire zones barren. Many vessels routinely under-report their catch, operate in restricted zones, or violate seasonal bans. Meanwhile, small-scale artisanal fishermen, who are the backbone of coastal economies, are now forced into deeper and more dangerous waters because nearshore fish have been depleted.\n\nBangladesh's regulatory framework is simply not equipped to handle this level of pressure. The country authorises far more industrial trawlers than its marine ecology can sustain. Monitoring is inadequate. Enforcement is sporadic. Coast guard resources are overstretched. Illegal operators often escape accountability through political protection or bribery. Scientific research capacity remains thin, leaving policymakers without accurate stock assessments or long-term ecological modelling.\n\nThe collapse in fish stock will not only affect marine biodiversity; it will shake the foundations of national nutrition and coastal economies. Marine fish supply makes up nearly 15 percent of Bangladesh's total animal protein intake. A sharp decline will raise food insecurity, increase protein deficiency, and widen nutritional inequality. For crores of coastal residents—from fishers and boatmen to traders, processors, and transport workers—marine fisheries are the primary source of income. A collapse in marine stocks means declining catch, lower earnings, rising debt, and a slide into deeper destitution. Coastal districts, already battered by cyclones, erosion, and salinity, will face additional economic hardship.\n\nThere is also a geopolitical dimension. As fish stocks decline, cross-border tensions over marine resources in the bay may intensify. Countries around the Bay of Bengal—India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka—are also grappling with declining fish populations. Competition for dwindling resources often leads to arrests of fishermen, maritime disputes, and escalations that strain diplomatic relations. Bangladesh cannot afford to let ecological collapse feed into geopolitical instability.\n\nThe nutritional consequences are equally serious. Bangladesh is already dealing with rising food inflation, reduced dietary diversity, and a growing burden of non-communicable diseases linked to a poor diet. Marine fish—comparatively affordable, accessible, and protein-rich—have long been a nutritional anchor for the poor. When fish disappear, households will be forced to shift to inferior protein sources or go without, accelerating hidden hunger, childhood stunting, and micronutrient deficiency.\n\nThis crisis reflects decades of policy neglect, political interference, weak enforcement, and an absence of a long-term vision for marine governance. Bangladesh possesses marine laws on paper, but laws do not protect oceans—institutions do. Without sustained political commitment, transparency, and science-based decision-making, no legal framework can prevent ecological collapse.\n\nTwo options are open for Bangladesh. The first is the continuation of the status quo, a path of slow death for the bay: allowing illegal trawlers to operate, letting industrial vessels destroy sea beds, ignoring scientific warnings and pretending that fish stocks will replenish themselves. If Bangladesh chooses this path, the collapse will deepen, and the bay may reach a point where recovery becomes impossible within a generation. The poor will suffer first and most, but eventually, urban consumers, national nutrition, and geopolitical stability will also be affected.\n\nThe other path is one of urgent recovery that demands political courage and institutional reform. First, Bangladesh must dramatically reduce the number of industrial trawlers. Many countries have implemented trawler buy-back programmes to reduce pressure on marine ecosystems; Bangladesh may need to consider similar policies. Second, enforcement must be strengthened, with modern vessel-tracking systems, real-time monitoring, and a fully empowered coast guard. Third, scientifically guided seasonal bans and no-take zones must be enforced without exception. Breeding grounds and nursery habitats have to be protected if the bay is to heal.\n\nFourth, Bangladesh must invest in marine science. The country needs updated stock assessments, habitat mapping, and ecosystem modelling to craft policies based on evidence rather than intuition. Finally, coastal communities must be supported with alternative livelihoods—aquaculture, eco-tourism, value-added fish processing—so that conservation does not come at the expense of human survival. In all of this, timing is crucial. The window for action is narrowing quickly.\n\nBangladesh has shown resilience in many areas of national life. Whether that resilience can be reactivated—decisively, intelligently, and urgently—will determine not only the future of the ocean but the future of crores of people who depend on it. The Bay of Bengal is a living asset, not an inexhaustible warehouse. Once its life collapses, no policy can bring it back quickly.\n\nThis generation has a choice to make. It can allow the bay to die slowly, its fishery wealth drained by neglect and exploitation; or it can act decisively by protecting, restoring, and managing the ocean with the seriousness the crisis demands.\n\nDr Abdullah A Dewanis professor emeritus of economics at Eastern Michigan University in the US and a former physicist and nuclear engineer of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission.

Such pairings, she noted, remain almost unthinkable in mainstream cinema, exposing how differently men and women are treated as they age.\n\n\"It's about women being denied the right to age with visibility, dignity, and complexity on screen,\" she shared, emphasising that her concern is not with men aging but with how women are systematically pushed aside.\n\nReflecting on the conversation later, Mirza shared on social media: \"The power years, truly! Women over 40 know their hearts and minds. I don't believe anyone gets to decide when a woman reaches her peak, when she becomes irrelevant, or when her story ends. We decide that for ourselves. Always.\"\n\nKnown for her advocacy on environmental issues and breaking traditions by choosing a female priest for her wedding, Mirza continues to use her platform to address inequality in various forms.\n\nOn the work front, the actor was last seen in \"Nadaaniyan\", which released in March 2025, playing a supporting role alongside debutants Ibrahim Ali Khan and Khushi Kapoor.​​\n\n",

Their spirited 3-2 loss to France in the final group match meant they finished third in Group F — level on points with Korea but ahead on goal difference -- a commendable outcome for a team playing its first-ever World Cup.\n\nReflecting on the match against France, Aikman said Bangladesh executed their game plan with discipline and maturity despite the intensity of the contest.\n\n\"We played a very good match. We tried to be composed, calm, disciplined and structured. We tried to attack where possible and prevent them from attacking. We played positive hockey,\" Aikman told T Sports after the match. \"We didn't only defend. We didn't play madman's hockey. We played good structured hockey for the future. We tried to accelerate where possible, play 2-v-1, create opportunities. We created opportunities. We also gave some opportunities away.\"\n\nHe stressed that Bangladesh's limited experience in high-tempo fixtures was telling against a seasoned French side.\n\n\"The more experienced team could handle it better than we did, because we have no experience in this kind of matches. It's very high pace, high-level hockey -- and you don't play that in Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether experience was the only difference between the teams, Aikman agreed.\n\n\"I think so, because if you look at it, we were almost equal. The score was 3-2, but we had chances. We could have even equalised if they had given us the stroke which we deserved,\" he added. \"France didn't miss many chances, and our PC defense was good, PC attack was good. All the elements, the building blocks, were good.\"\n\nHaving completed the group stage with impressive progress in Chennai, the Bangladesh team will now move to Madurai for the classification matches (17th–24th), starting against Oman on Friday.",

        "headline": "Stars join public outcry after eight puppies found drowned in Ishwardi",
        "full_news": "A wave of outrage has swept Bangladesh after eight newborn puppies were found dumped in a pond in Ishwardi, Pabna — an act that celebrities, animal lovers and local officials have condemned as cruel and unforgivable.\n\nSocial media erupted after images and accounts of the incident circulated, drawing sharp condemnation from stars including Jaya Ahsan, Peya Jannatul, Niloy Alamgir and Tawsif Mahbub, who demanded the harshest possible punishment for those responsible.\n\nJaya Ahsan wrote on Facebook, \"A cruel, merciless, mentally unbalanced person has killed eight puppies in Ishwardi. I demand the strictest punishment for the killer.\"\n\nNiloy Alamgir posted that the mother dog had been left beside her dead pups and asked readers to imagine the animals' last desperate struggles in the sack before they drowned. \"Think of the pain the mother is now feeling,\" he wrote. \"She may die from grief. I call for the maximum penalty for this murder.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe episode intensified public pressure on local authorities. Three days after the bodies were found on Saturday (November 29) morning near the Upazila Parishad auditorium pond, the administration ordered the removal of the accused official from the government residence.\n\nThe Ishwardi Upazila Nirbahi Officer, Moniruzzaman, said the official — identified as Hasanur Rahman Nayon, an Ishwardi officer with the Small Farmers Development Foundation — was directed to vacate the government bungalow as a disciplinary measure. Local police recovered the eight bodies wrapped in a sack and said the pups had been killed before being dumped.\n\nNayon, who has acknowledged the incident, told reporters that his wife had asked him to \"remove\" the puppies for the safety of their children, but claimed he did not expect them to be disposed of in this manner. \"I am ashamed and sorry about what happened,\" he said.\n\nResidents say a mother dog in the officer's compound had given birth to the litter about a week earlier. On Saturday, neighbours followed the mother's plaintive cries and found the puppies' bodies in the pond. Villagers said the mother sat by the graves and howled.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Upazila administration has assigned the Department of Livestock Services to care for the mother dog, and the police say they are investigating the case under animal cruelty provisions. Online, many users have urged stricter enforcement of animal protection laws; others called for public education about humane treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nActress Peya Jannatul wrote, \"Being a government officer's wife doesn't grant anyone the right to act with impunity — today's arrest makes that crystal clear. Throwing eight helpless puppies into a pond inside a bag isn't just cruelty; it's a stain on our humanity.\"\n\n\"For anyone who believes animals are voiceless and therefore disposable, consider this your warning. The people of this country — and its laws — will no longer look away. Punishments will grow tougher. Before harming an animal, remember: they feel pain, they have lives. The era of abusing the powerless is over. Accountability has begun,\" she concludes.\n\n",

        "headline": "Caretaker by court and by charter: Are we headed for a collision?",
        "full_news": "Bangladesh now has one idea for election-time governance running on three tracks. The High Court has ruled that the 15th Amendment's abolition of the caretaker system violated the basic structure and revived both referendums and the possibility of a neutral election-time government, in effect reopening the constitution's Chapter IIA that parliament had deleted in 2011. ItsDecember 2024 judgment(full verdict published in July 2025) struck down the provisions that abolished the caretaker system and removed the referendum mechanism. The National Consensus Commission'sJuly National Charter 2025also offers a political blueprint for that system. Meanwhile, the Appellate Division, reviewing the 13th Amendment case ofAbdul Mannan Khan v Bangladesh, has restored the 13th Amendment and branded the 2011 judgment of then Chief Justice ABM Khairul Haque as \"tainted,\" while keeping the next election under the Professor Yunus-led interim government and reserving the caretaker for future polls.\n\nWhether these tracks ultimately align or pull against one another is a core constitutional question.\n\nThe starting point of this tension lies in the 2011 verdict. In the original 13th Amendment case, the Appellate Division, led by Chief Justice Khairul Haque, declared the caretaker system inconsistent with democracy, yet allowed two more elections under it through prospective overruling. The then parliament treated that short order as a green light and rushed through the 15th Amendment, abolishing the caretaker provisions and referendums. That sequence enabled three contested elections in 2014, 2018, and 2024, which the High Court now openly links to the July 2024 uprising and the collapse of the Awami regime.\n\nThat said, the High Court's December 2024 judgment on the 15th Amendment did more than reopen the door to a caretaker government and restore referendums. It held that the abolition of the caretaker model undermined democracy, free and fair elections, judicial independence, and popular sovereignty, and treated the system as part of the constitution's basic structure. It also struck down Article 7B, amongst others, which had tried to make large parts of the constitution unamendable, and revived the referendum clause in Article 142. The student-led July uprising, the interim government formed after an Article 106 reference, and the six reform commissions under the charter—all pushed in the same direction: a neutral election-time government became politically unavoidable.\n\nThe July Charter is the clearest expression of that political consensus, and its caretaker chapter departs sharply from the original 13th Amendment. Instead of automatically appointing the last retired chief justice as chief adviser, it creates a five-member selection committee drawn from the prime minister, opposition leadership, and the presiding officers of parliament. The committee would invite nominations from parties and independents, may search for its own candidates, and must agree on a chief adviser who meets the Article 58C criteria. If that process, including a second round of shortlists, still fails, the charter falls back on the 13th Amendment mechanism but bars the president from serving as chief adviser.\n\nThis entire package is what will go to referendum on the same day as the national election under the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Implementation Order, 2025, and the Referendum Ordinance, 2025. The question for voters is whether they endorse the inclusion of the July charter in the constitution. It is a blunt instrument. Citizens cannot support term limits, a bicameral legislature, or stronger rights while rejecting this particular caretaker architecture. Nor can they choose between the charter model and whatever institutional design the Appellate Division ultimately reads into the revived 13th Amendment when its full judgment appears. The referendum will generate a single political mandate for the charter; the court is simultaneously generating a judicial mandate for a specific reading of Chapter IIA.\n\nThe new Appellate Divisionshort orderalready signals that it will not be content with a minimalist approach. By calling the Khairul Haque judgment \"tainted\" and setting it aside \"in its entirety,\" the court has effectively endorsed the High Court's core premise that the caretaker system is compatible with, and possibly required by, the basic structure. It has also chosen to restore Chapter IIA prospectively only, keeping the coming election under the interim government and reserving the caretaker model for the 14th parliament. That sequencing shows a court that views itself as managing the transition rather than simply cleaning up an old doctrinal mistake. A court that sees its role this way is unlikely to avoid saying something about the composition and appointment of the future caretaker government.\n\nThis is where the discomfort becomes doctrinal. If the full judgment treats the detailed 13th Amendment model as part of the basic structure, any attempt to constitutionalise the July charter's selection committee will face a basic structure challenge. Parliament cannot use Article 142, even with a referendum, to amend what the court has held to be the basic structure. Yet the charter's drafters have tried to anchor their model in the 13th Amendment by borrowing its eligibility criteria and writing in a last-resort default to the original mechanism. Each side will claim to be the defender of the 13th Amendment's spirit rather than its saboteur.\n\nThe two projects, however, do not have to collide. Legally, there are at least two ways to avoid a clash. The Appellate Division could use the full judgment to identify only the core features of the caretaker system as basic structure—neutrality, a limited non-legislative mandate, and a 90-day time limit with a narrow extension—while leaving appointment of the chief adviser to politics. That would provide parliament and the referendum space to adopt the July charter's committee-based model. Alternatively, the caretaker provisions of the charter could first be implemented through ordinary constitutional law operating \"subject to the 13th Amendment,\" treating the charter as a political code of practice rather than an immediate textual rewrite of Chapter IIA.\n\nPolitically, Bangladesh is now running two projects of constitutional legitimacy. One is led by judges trying to undo the damage of an earlier court and a discredited partisan decade. The other is driven by a fragile multi-party compromise embodied in the July charter and about to be tested in a binary referendum. Unless the interim government, the main parties, and the court treat both the charter and the forthcoming judgment as starting points, rather than sacred texts, the country risks moving from one era of constitutional conflict into another. After years of arguing over whether there should be a caretaker government at all, we may now be heading for a second argument over which caretaker government the constitution will actually permit.\n\nBarrister Khan Khalid Adnanis advocate at the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, fellow at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, and head of the chamber at Khan Saifur Rahman and Associates in Dhaka.Views expressed in this article are the author's own.FollowThe Daily Star Opinion on Facebookfor the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.

The company called the move a \"disappointing update\" that it argues will not improve online safety, as per a recent report by Reuters.\n\nThe decision follows a standoff with the Australian government, which recently passed a law prohibiting platforms from allowing users under 16 to hold accounts, explains the report. Major platforms, including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat, have previously agreed to comply. The law carries potential fines of up to A$49.5 million for violations.\n\nIn a statement, YouTube stated that the law \"will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube.\" The company argues that its parental control features only function when a child is signed into their account, adds the report.\n\nFrom December 10, affected users will be automatically signed out. While they can still view content, they will lose the ability to log in, post videos, subscribe to channels, or like and comment. The platform did not specify how it will verify a user's age. According to Australia's eSafety Commissioner, YouTube has approximately 325,000 accounts held by Australians aged 13 to 15.\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells responded to YouTube's criticism, stating it was \"weird\" the company would highlight safety concerns about its own platform in a logged-out state. She said the issue was one YouTube needed to address.\n\nThe Australian ban is being closely monitored by other governments considering similar age-based restrictions on social media access.",

        "headline": "How Bangladesh continues to abandon its disabled citizens",
        "full_news": "The paradox of disability in Bangladesh is stark: we are a country that legislates compassion on paper but constructs hostility in concrete. Bangladesh's disabled population stands at over36 lakh. They are, at least nominally, protected under the constitution, theRights and Protection of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2013, and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which the countryratifiedin 2007. Yet, the lived reality for these citizens is one of structural abandonment. Accessibility is rare, dignity is conditional, and rights exist largely as bureaucratic artefacts. As we approach the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we must confront an uncomfortable truth: the state has mastered the art of acknowledging disabled people while simultaneously excluding them.\n\nThe constitutional framework is unequivocal. Article 15(d) obliges the state to provide social protection; Article 19 ensures equality of opportunity; and Article 27 guarantees equality before the law. Parliament responded with the Rights and Protection of Persons with Disabilities Act, which, in theory, promises accessibility, education, and employment. However, the subsequentRights and Protection of Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2015, exposed the system's fatal weaknesses—the very instrument meant to operationalise this act—by prioritising form over function, focusing on committee compositions and certification timelines while remaining silent on technical accessibility standards. They prescribe 30-day windows for issuing certificates but fail to mandate ramp gradients, tactile paving specifications, or minimum door widths.\n\nThis regulatory hollowness is etched into Dhaka's urban landscape. The majority of public buildings, courts, and hospitals remain inaccessible. Sidewalks are not just difficult; they are death traps for wheelchair users and the visually impaired. Even modern triumphs like the Metro Rail become islands of exclusion when the footpaths leading to them are broken or blocked. These are not mere infrastructural oversights; they are daily violations of Section 34 of the act. Without mandatory technical standards tied to building approvals, \"accessibility\" remains a subjective favour rather than an enforceable right.\n\nRead moreEnsure the rights of persons with disabilitiesThe administrative failure is equally stark. The national registry, resulting in the Suborno Nagorik Card (Golden Citizen Card), which is a unique identification card for persons with disabilities, has made millions visible on a ledger but invisible in life. An identification card should be a passport to services; in Bangladesh, it has become a paper talisman. Holders of the card still queue for inaccessible services and are turned away from recruitment drives. The card grants identity but not access. This stands in sharp contrast to functional systems abroad. India's Unique Disability ID (UDID) pairs identification with municipal one-stop centres; Brazil's Benefício de Prestação Continuada (Continuous Cash Benefit) under the Organic Law of Social Assistance (LOAS) ties identity to means-tested cash benefits; and the UK's Access to Work programme links registration directly to workplace adaptations. These countries succeed because they treat the ID card as a trigger for funded services, not merely a statistic.The human cost of this failure is currently visible on Dhaka's streets. In recent weeks, educated, degree-holding disabled graduates have stagedsit-ins and hunger strikes. These are citizens who did everything the state asked: they obtained education, registered for their cards, and applied for jobs. Their exclusion represents a tragic waste of human capital, potentially costing the national economy millions in lost GDP and productivity. Yet, they remain shut out because the quota systems and \"reservations\" mentioned in the act lack enforcement mechanisms. There is no statutory compulsion for public institutions to fill reserved posts, and no financial penalty for those who ignore them. The committees tasked with oversight are housed within the very ministries they are supposed to monitor, lacking both independence and the teeth to impose sanctions.To shift from symbolic inclusion to operational reality, the government must move beyond vague directives.

The national registry, resulting in the Suborno Nagorik Card (Golden Citizen Card), which is a unique identification card for persons with disabilities, has made millions visible on a ledger but invisible in life. An identification card should be a passport to services; in Bangladesh, it has become a paper talisman. Holders of the card still queue for inaccessible services and are turned away from recruitment drives. The card grants identity but not access. This stands in sharp contrast to functional systems abroad. India's Unique Disability ID (UDID) pairs identification with municipal one-stop centres; Brazil's Benefício de Prestação Continuada (Continuous Cash Benefit) under the Organic Law of Social Assistance (LOAS) ties identity to means-tested cash benefits; and the UK's Access to Work programme links registration directly to workplace adaptations. These countries succeed because they treat the ID card as a trigger for funded services, not merely a statistic.\n\nThe human cost of this failure is currently visible on Dhaka's streets. In recent weeks, educated, degree-holding disabled graduates have stagedsit-ins and hunger strikes. These are citizens who did everything the state asked: they obtained education, registered for their cards, and applied for jobs. Their exclusion represents a tragic waste of human capital, potentially costing the national economy millions in lost GDP and productivity. Yet, they remain shut out because the quota systems and \"reservations\" mentioned in the act lack enforcement mechanisms. There is no statutory compulsion for public institutions to fill reserved posts, and no financial penalty for those who ignore them. The committees tasked with oversight are housed within the very ministries they are supposed to monitor, lacking both independence and the teeth to impose sanctions.\n\nTo shift from symbolic inclusion to operational reality, the government must move beyond vague directives. Legislative reform is required to mandate detailed technical accessibility standards, linking building occupancy certificates strictly to compliance. The Suvarna Nagorik Card must be transformed into a service-linked instrument, where issuance automatically triggers eligibility for assistive devices, transport concessions, and social safety net payments. Furthermore, the fragmented bureaucracy needs to be replaced by ward-level one-stop centres that bundle certification and benefits, sparing families the indignity of navigating a hostile administration.\n\nMost urgently, the state must establish an independent enforcement authority with the power to audit ministries and impose penalties for non-compliance with employment quotas.

We had a couple of chances to equalise and in the last second they scored the third,\" Oblak told Movistar.\n\nAtletico coach Simeone said his team gave their all and could not fault them despite the result which cut short their charge up the table after six straight league wins prior.\n\n\"I'm happy with the team's performance and we competed well,\" said the Argentine.\n\n\"We couldn't be efficient in front of goal, that's what we ask for but sometimes it doesn't happen.\"",

        "headline": "The AI frenzy is driving a new global supply chain crisis",
        "full_news": "An acute global shortage of memory chips is forcing artificial intelligence and consumer-electronics companies to fight for dwindling supplies, as prices soar for the unglamorous but essential components that allow devices to store data.\n\nJapanese electronics stores have begun limiting how many hard-disk drives shoppers can buy. Chinese smartphone makers are warning of price increases. Tech giants including Microsoft, Google and ByteDance are scrambling to secure supplies from memory-chip makers such as Micron, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe squeeze spans almost every type of memory, from flash chips used in USB drives and smartphones to advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that feeds AI chips in data centers. Prices in some segments have more than doubled since February, according to market-research firm TrendForce, drawing in traders betting that the rally has further to run.\n\nThe fallout could reach beyond tech. Many economists and executives warn the protracted shortage risks slowing AI-based productivity gains and delaying hundreds of billions of dollars in digital infrastructure. It could also add inflationary pressure just as many economies are trying to tame price rises and navigate U.S. tariffs.\n\n\"The memory shortage has now graduated from a component-level concern to a macroeconomic risk,\" said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of Greyhound Research, a technology advisory firm. The AI build-out \"is colliding with a supply chain that cannot meet its physical requirements.\"\n\nThis Reuters examination of the spiraling supply crisis is based on interviews with almost 40 people, including 17 executives at chipmakers and distributors. It shows industry efforts to meet voracious appetite for advanced chips — driven by Nvidia NVDA.O and tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Alibaba 9988.HK — created a dual bind: Chipmakers still can't produce enough high-end semiconductors for the AI race, yet their tilt away from traditional memory products is choking supply to smartphones, PCs and consumer electronics. Some are now hurrying to course-correct.\n\nDetails of the global scramble by tech firms and price increases described by electronics retailers and component suppliers in China and Japan are reported here for the first time.\n\nAverage inventory levels at suppliers of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) — the main type used in computers and phones — fell to two to four weeks in October from three to eight weeks in July and 13 to 17 weeks in late 2024, according to TrendForce.\n\nThe crunch is unfolding as investors question whether the billions of dollars poured into AI infrastructure have inflated a bubble. Some analysts predict a shakeout, with only the biggest and financially strongest companies able to stomach the price increases.\n\nOne memory-chip executive told Reuters the shortage would delay future data-center projects. New capacity takes at least two years to build but memory-chip makers are wary of overbuilding for fear it could end up idle should the demand surge pass, the person said.\n\nSamsung and SK Hynix have announced investments in new capacity but haven't detailed the production split between HBM and conventional memory.\n\nSK Hynix has told analysts that the memory shortfall would last through late 2027, Citi said in November.\n\n\"These days, we're receiving requests for memory supplies from so many companies that we're worried about how we'll be able to handle all of them. If we fail to supply them, they could face a situation where they can't do business at all,\" Chey Tae-won, chairman of SK Hynix parent SK Group, said at an industry forum in Seoul last month.\n\nOpenAI in October signed initial deals with Samsung and SK Hynix to supply chips for its Stargate project, which would require up to 900,000 wafers per month by 2029. That's about double current global monthly HBM production, Chey said.\n\nSamsung told Reuters it is monitoring the market but wouldn't comment on pricing or customer relationships. SK Hynix said it is boosting production capacity to meet increased memory demand.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment and ByteDance didn't address questions about the chip strain. Micron and Google didn't respond to comment requests.\n\nAfter ChatGPT's release in November 2022 ignited the generative AI boom, a global rush to build AI data centers led memory makers to allocate more production to HBM, used in Nvidia's powerful AI processors.\n\nCompetition from Chinese rivals making lower-end DRAM, such as ChangXin Memory Technologies, also pushed Samsung and SK Hynix to accelerate their shift to higher-margin products. The South Korean firms account for two-thirds of the DRAM market.\n\nSamsung told customers in May 2024 that it planned to end production of one type of DDR4 chips — an older variety used in PCs and servers — this year, according to a letter seen by Reuters. (The company has since changed course and will extend production, two sources said.) In June, Micron said it had informed customers it would stop shipping DDR4 and its counterpart LPDDR4 - a type used in smartphones - in six to nine months.\n\nChangXin followed suit in ending most DDR4 production, one source said. The firm declined to comment.\n\nThis shift, however, coincided with a replacement cycle for traditional data centers and PCs, as well as stronger-than-expected sales of smartphones, which rely on conventional chips.\n\nIn hindsight, \"one could say the industry was caught off-guard,\" said Dan Hutcheson, senior research fellow at TechInsights.\n\nSamsung raised prices of server memory chips by up to 60% last month, Reuters has reported. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who in October announced deals and shared fried chicken with Samsung Electronics Chairman Jay Y. Lee during a trip to South Korea, acknowledged the price surge as significant but said Nvidia had secured substantial supply.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta in October asked Micron for open-ended orders, telling the company they will take as much as it can deliver, irrespective of price, according to two people briefed on the talks.\n\nChina's Alibaba, ByteDance and Tencent 0700.HK are also leaning on suppliers, dispatching executives to visit Samsung and SK Hynix in October and November to lobby for allocation, the two people and another source told Reuters.\n\n\"Everyone is begging for supply,\" one said.\n\nThe Chinese firms didn't address questions about the chip crunch. Nvidia, Meta META.O, Amazon AMZN.O and OpenAI didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn October, SK Hynix said all its chips are sold out for 2026, while Samsung said it had secured customers for its HBM chips to be produced next year. Both firms are expanding capacity to meet AI demand, but new factories for conventional chips won't come online until 2027 or 2028.\n\nShares in Micron, Samsung and SK Hynix have rallied this year on chip demand. In September, Micron forecast first-quarter revenue above market estimates while Samsung in October reported its biggest quarterly profit in more than three years.\n\nConsultancy Counterpoint Research expects prices of advanced and legacy memory to rise by 30% through the fourth quarter and possibly another 20% in early 2026.\n\nChinese smartphone makers Xiaomi 1810.HK and Realme have warned they may have to raise prices.\n\nFrancis Wong, Realme India's chief marketing officer, told Reuters the steep increases in memory costs were \"unprecedented since the advent of smartphones\" and could force the company to lift handset prices by 20% to 30% by June.\n\n\"Some manufacturers might save costs on imaging cameras, some on processors, and some on batteries,\" he said. \"But the cost of storage is something all manufacturers must completely absorb; there's no way to transfer it.\"\n\nXiaomi told Reuters it would offset higher memory costs by raising prices and selling more premium phones, adding that its other businesses would help cushion the impact.\n\nIn November, Taiwanese laptop maker ASUS said it had about four months of inventory, including memory components, and would adjust pricing as needed.\n\nWinbond 2344.TW, a Taiwanese chipmaker with around 1% of the DRAM market, was among the first to announce a capacity expansion to meet demand. Its board of directors approved a plan in October to sharply boost capital expenditure to $1.1 billion.\n\n\"Many customers have been coming to us saying, 'I really need your help,' and one even asked for a six-year long-term agreement,\" Winbond's President Pei-Ming Chen said.\n\nIn Tokyo's electronics hub of Akihabara, stores are restricting purchases of memory products to curb hoarding. A sign outside PC shop Ark says that since November 1 customers have been limited to buying a total of eight products across hard-disk drives, solid-state drives and system memory. Ark declined to comment.\n\nClerks at five shops said shortages had pushed prices sharply higher in recent weeks. At some stores, one-third of products were sold out.\n\nProducts such as 32-gigabyte DDR5 memory – popular with gamers – were over 47,000 yen, up from around 17,000 yen in mid-October. Higher-end 128-gigabyte kits had more than doubled to around 180,000 yen.\n\nThe hikes are driving customers to the secondhand market — benefiting people like Roman Yamashita, owner of iCON in Akihabara, who said his business selling used PC parts is booming.\n\nEva Wu, a sales manager at component trader Polaris Mobility in Shenzhen, said prices are changing so rapidly that distributors issue broker-style quotes that expire daily – and in some cases hourly – versus monthly before the crunch.\n\nIn Beijing, a DDR4 seller said she had hoarded 20,000 units in anticipation of further increases.\n\nSome 6,000 miles away in California, Paul Coronado said monthly sales at his company, Caramon, which sells recycled low-end memory chips pulled from decommissioned data-center servers, have surged since September. Almost all its products are now bought by Hong Kong-based intermediaries who resell them to Chinese clients, he said.\n\n\"We were doing about $500,000 a month,\" he said. \"Now it's $800,000 to $900,000.\"",

One member of the National Guard was killed and another was critically wounded in the shooting.\n\nTrump has also stepped up rhetoric against Somalis in recent days, calling them \"garbage\" and saying \"we don't want them in our country.\"\n\nSince returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritized immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.\n\nThe flurry of promised restrictions since the attack on National Guard members suggests an increased focus on legal immigration framed around protecting national security and casting blame on former President Joe Biden for his policies.\n\nThe list of countries targeted in Wednesday's memorandum includes Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, which were subjected to the most severe immigration restrictions in June, including a full suspension on entries with a few exceptions.\n\nOthers on the list of 19 countries, which were subjected to partial restrictions in June, are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nThe new policy places a hold on pending applications and mandates that all immigrants from the list of countries \"undergo a thorough re-review process, including a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview, to fully assess all national security and public safety threats.\"\n\nThe memorandum cited several recent crimes suspected to have been committed by immigrants, including the National Guard attack.\n\nSharvari Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the organization had received reports of cancelled oath ceremonies, naturalization interviews and adjustment of status interviews for individuals from countries listed on the travel ban.",

        "full_news": "Erling Haaland said he was \"proud\" to make history as the Manchester City striker became the fastest player to reach 100 Premier League goals in Tuesday's pulsating 5-4 win against Fulham.\n\nHaaland's clinical finish in the first half at Craven Cottage took him to his century in just 111 league appearances for City.\n\nThe 25-year-old broke the previous record set by former Newcastle and Blackburn star Alan Shearer, who took 124 matches to reach 100 goals.\n\n\"It's huge and I'm really proud. Of course it's a massive thing, 100 club is a nice thing to be in and I'm happy,\" Haaland said.\n\n\"I knew about the record, that's what I tried to do. I try to help the team scoring goals, that's my job.\"\n\nHaaland, who signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, had failed to score in his previous three games against Newcastle, Bayer Leverkusen and Leeds.\n\nHe broke that mini-drought with the latest milestone in his glittering City career.\n\nOf Haaland's 100 goals, 71 came with his left foot and 17 with his head.\n\n\"When you're a striker for Man City you should be delivering great numbers,\" he said.\n\n\"That's my job, people should criticise me if I don't and that's normally what they do. I should deliver.\"\n\nHe produced a sumptuous finish to put City ahead in the 17th minute against Fulham, giving him 15 league goals this term and 20 in all competitions.\n\nJeremy Doku provided the assist with a precise cut-back and Haaland timed his run perfectly to unleash a ferocious blast that whistled past Fulham keeper Bernd Leno from 12 yards.\n\n\"I think if you're sitting at home now you enjoyed that game. It was a crazy game, nine goals is a lot. In the end, we win and we're happy but it's not the best win,\" Haaland said.\n\nWith City now only two points behind leaders Arsenal, Haaland added: \"It's important, Arsenal came here and won here. Fulham are a great team but we shouldn't think too much about Arsenal.\n\n\"We should focus on ourselves, today wasn't good enough and we know this. We need to improve as a team and that's what we'll do.\"\n\nHaaland still has a long way to go to break Shearer's most significant record, with the former England captain holding the Premier League's all-time scoring mark on 260 goals.\n\n\"I know about it but I don't think too much about it,\" he said.",

        "full_news": "Uncapped pace-bowling all-rounder Abdul Gaffar Saqlain emerged as one of the biggest surprises of the 12th Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) auction, with Rajshahi Warriors snapping him up for Tk 44 lakh -- far above his Tk 14 lakh base price.The 27-year-old, who bypassed traditional age-level pathways, recently gained attention with a strong showing at the Rising Stars Asia Cup in Qatar. In an interview with The Daily Star's Samsul Arefin Khan, Saqlain discussed his unconventional cricketing journey and development into a multi-format player after starting in tape-tennis cricket. The following are excerpts:\n\nThe Daily Star (DS): How excited are you to be picked for the BPL for the first time?Abdul Gaffar Saqlain (AGS): For any new player, getting a chance in such a big tournament feels amazing.\n\nDS: How did your family react?AGS: I was outside when the auction started. When I returned, it was already underway. My mother, younger brother, and aunties were watching from home. My brother became very excited when my name came up, and my mother -- who was reciting the Quran after Maghrib as usual -- was very happy when Rajshahi picked me.\n\nDS: After strong performances in the Rising Stars Asia Cup and domestic cricket, how confident were you about getting a BPL team?AGS: Wherever I play, I just try to give my best. I managed to do that this year -- but ultimately, Allah made it happen.\n\nDS: You didn't come through traditional age-group cricket. What was your journey like?AGS: I never played U-16, U-17, U-18, or U-19. I started playing in my locality. An elder brother once told me I had talent and should try cricket-ball cricket. At Saidpur, I performed well in a tournament at the Railway Ground, then played a year in Third Division. I spent two years at Gazi Tyres, moved to Kakrail Boys in First Division, then returned to Gazi Tyres. We earned promotion to First Division and became champions to qualify for the Premier League. That same year, I was called up for the National League -- even before my premier league debut. My first premier league wicket was Tamim Iqbal, which I'll never forget.\n\nDS: Many say the HP Programme changed your career. What did that opportunity mean?AGS: I always wanted to attend a camp, so getting into the HP camp made me extremely happy. HP helps with screening, fitness, mentality, strength, and discipline. I loved the environment and tried to learn as much as possible.\n\nDS: You have a long history in tape-tennis cricket. How did it shape your journey?AGS: People think I reached the BPL only because of tape-tennis, but that's not true. I played tape-tennis, but also club cricket. I played two years each in Third and Second Division, and seven to eight years in club cricket overall. Before league season, I would stop tape-tennis and prepare for two months. My performances in club cricket earned me promotions throughout my career.\n\nDS: After playing abroad in the Rising Stars Asia Cup and now getting a BPL call-up, what's your vision?AGS: Like any player, I dream of representing my country. I want to serve Bangladesh for a long time, and I pray that Allah helps me achieve that.",

        "full_news": "The US Department of Justice has dismissed eight immigration judges in New York City, the association representing them said Tuesday, amid tensions with the courts as President Donald Trump's administration cracks down on undocumented migrants.\n\nAccording to the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), which confirmed media reports, the eight judges all worked at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. The address houses a court that reviews cases of migrants attempting to regularize their status.\n\nFor months, masked federal officers have been patrolling the hallways of the Jacob K. Javitz Federal Building daily. The officers make arrests of migrants as they leave hearings, but under the watchful eye of the press, which is frequently present.\n\nImages of scuffles with police and of immigrant families being separated have gone viral around the world, making 26 Federal Plaza a symbolic site of the Trump administration's crackdown on migrants nationwide.\n\nIt's unclear what led to the eight New York judges being dismissed. However, they join approximately 90 judges who were dismissed over the year across the country out of about 600, according to a report by the New York Times.\n\nAs migrant advocacy groups see them, these dismissals are aimed at replacing the outgoing judges with others who are more aligned with the administration's immigration policy.\n\nThe dismissals took place after several dozen people gathered in Manhattan over the weekend to try to prevent a possible raid by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) against street vendors. The New York police made several arrests.\n\nAs a so-called sanctuary city for migrants, New York City voluntarily limits cooperation between its local authorities and federal immigration services. However, it does not prevent their operations.",

        "headline": "Tigers upbeat, but problems persist",
        "full_news": "As it often happens, a victory -- especially before a major tournament -- can lift the mood within the Bangladesh team.\n\nYesterday was no different. There was a stark contrast between the Litton Das who spoke to the media after Bangladesh's comeback series win over Ireland in Chattogram and the one who faced reporters a week earlier, just before the three-match series began.\n\nSmiling, relaxed, even cracking jokes, skipper Litton was understandably delighted after the Tigers sealed the series 2-1 with a dominant eight-wicket win on Tuesday, despite being thrashed in the opener.\n\nJust days ago, Litton had entered the pre-series press conference with a stern expression and raised doubts about continuing as captain. This time, he brushed aside any uncertainty about his leadership and spoke openly about his World Cup ambitions ahead of the tournament starting next February.\n\nBut have all reasons for concern disappeared? The simple answer is: No.\n\nAddressing the continued struggles of the middle order, which again failed to score in this series, Litton downplayed the issue, saying what \"matters most now is to play well in the World Cup\".\n\nOne thing appears certain: even if the middle order continues to misfire, their World Cup spots do not seem in doubt.\n\nBangladesh's middle-order problems are hardly new; the T20 side has looked shaky in this department for a long time. Even when runs come, they rarely influence match results. The Ireland series did little to change that outlook. Bangladesh did win the series after falling behind, and as often happens, victories tend to mask deeper issues. When results go your way, shortcomings become easier to overlook.\n\nBeating Ireland was fully expected -- even a 3-0 win against a lower-ranked side at home would not have been cause for excessive celebration. What mattered more was whether the gaps were addressed. For now, the team seems reluctant to confront that question.\n\nIn this series, Jaker Ali struggled in the first match and was dropped for Nurul Hasan Sohan, who performed even worse in the second game and was then omitted for the decider. Litton, however, is not overly worried: \"No, brother, I'm not very concerned. I've said before -- not every department or every player will perform well every time. And look at [Tawhid] Hridoy -- he had been struggling for a big score for a while, but in this series he got one. It means every player is capable of scoring big. They just need some time.\"\n\nLitton referred to Hridoy's 83 off 50 balls in the first T20I -- although most of those runs came after Bangladesh were already headed toward defeat.\n\nShamim Hossain, who returned for the final T20I after controversy surrounding his exclusion earlier, did not get a chance to bat. Mahidul Islam Ankon, included in the squad with hopes of testing him in one match -- preferably after Bangladesh had sealed the series -- ended up only posing with the trophy.\n\nIronically, Litton later said he \"never really thought about trying someone new there [in the middle order],\" raising questions about Ankon's selection in the first place.\n\nLitton suggested extraordinary performances in the upcoming Bangladesh Premier League could \"open doors\" for players, but also noted that \"you can't drop someone who's performing.\"\n\nOther than Hridoy's knock in a losing cause, the middle order rarely looked settled, leaving plenty of doubts in the batting order. Gains made in bilateral series have repeatedly overshadowed the inconsistencies and fragility of the Tigers, who seem to focus more on the \"winning momentum\".\n\nGoing into the World Cup with a settled squad is undoubtedly positive. But if performance gaps persist, that stability could quickly become a drawback.",

        "headline": "How NEIR exposed our lazy journalism",
        "full_news": "It is disheartening to see that, as journalists, we are losing both our inquisitiveness and our capacity for critical thinking. Instead, our work is increasingly tilting towards relaying and amplifying pre-processed information—much like the growing fascination with processed foods. Laziness may be partly responsible for this habit. Cooking requires thought, preparation, and labour; processed food, by contrast, sits on shelves or in freezers waiting to be consumed with minimal effort. Lazy journalism is just as convenient: communication experts package information that advances their employers' political or commercial interests and deliver it to journalists—often to familiar faces—through digital communication or courtesy visits.\n\nProfessional training and ethics require journalists to examine such processed content critically, rigorously analyse it, ask pertinent questions, verify both current and historical facts, and then reprocess the information for publication or broadcast. In doing so, misinformation, untruths, and unsubstantiated claims should be filtered out, and necessary context added. Unfortunately, the current trend in the media industry appears to abandon these basic principles of a profession fundamentally rooted in public service.\n\nThe reporting on the government's new mandatory registration of mobile handsets and the protests by sellers illustrate our waning curiosity and failure to ask critical, public-interest questions.\n\nBangladesh's telecom regulator, BTRC, is set to launch the National Equipment Identity Register (NEIR) on December 16, under which every mobile phone must have its International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) registered. One would naturally ask why the authorities are making this registration mandatory 32 years after mobile phones first appeared in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, BTRC Commissioner Mahmud Hossain told a Dhaka seminar that the registration drive is intended\"to restore market discipline and enhance security.\"Citing a flood of cloned handsets, BTRC's director general, Brig Gen Md Aminul Hoque, claimed that around 50 lakh devices are active under only five valid IMEI numbers. How 50 lakh fake mobiles can enter a market evading customs and other law-enforcing agencies is quite mind-boggling.\n\nThe idea ofmandatory IMEI registrationwas originally floated during the previous autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina in 2020. The justification was the same even then: curbing cloned, or fake devices, allegedly used in crimes. Authorities also claimed that unscrupulous traders smuggle refurbished or low-quality phones, and even top-tier brands, by evading taxes. But facing some resistance, that initiative was then frozen.\n\nIt is evident that NEIR is being imposed on consumers for two reasons: (i) to mask the failures of agencies responsible for combating phone cloning and device-related crimes, and (ii) to curb tax evasion and boost government revenue.\n\nBoth arise from governance failures, yet consumers are the ones expected to endure the inconvenience of registering their phones.\n\nRegistering a phone's IMEI—a unique 15-digit identifier—against a National Identity (NID) Card is nearly impossible for many low-income earners and for people with limited numeracy. They will need assistance, which will cost money.\n\nUndoubtedly, tech-literate users do understand the value of knowing their phone's IMEI, especially for reporting losses. But police rarely recover stolen phones. In my own experience, they do not even follow up with investigation updates. This is not unique to Bangladesh; globally, recovering stolen phones is uncommon because the cost of policing often outweighs the value of the device—unless the victim is a prominent figure.\n\nOfficials claim that NEIR is a global practice. A simple check of open-source information would show otherwise. In most of Europe, NEIR is not mandatory, just as SIM registration is not required. One can buy a phone at duty-free upon arrival at Heathrow or Vienna airport, and upon exiting immigration, can pick up a SIM with a data or voice package from any convenience store—no questions asked, no ID required. If the government insists on enforcing NEIR, existing mobile subscribers will again face identity verification, similar to when purchasing SIM cards.\n\nWe all know the government's poor record in safeguarding citizens' personal data. In 2015, BTRC compelled biometric SIM registration, claiming it would prevent SIM cloning and related crimes. Not only did the scheme fail, but it also exposed users' personal information through repeated data breaches. Misuse of subscriber data became so rampant that BTRC had to issuea directiveto mobile operators to ensure data protection. Breaches were not limited to telecom operators; the NID database was also compromised.\n\nIt can also be argued that the NEIR is an expansion of the government's surveillance capabilities—a power that has long been a cause of concern for its abuse, violating fundamental privacy rights, particularly against dissenting voices. Investigations into abusive and criminal behaviours by members of security agencies during the previous regime have shown that surveilling mobile phones was a common practice to crack down on opposition activists.\n\nNow, as the government attempts to impose yet another unnecessary scheme to conceal the incompetence of enforcement agencies—BTRC, police, customs—citizens are once again expected to bear the burden. Is this not déjà vu?\n\nA final curiosity: why would a group of journalists, under the banner of the Telecom and Technology Reporters' Network Bangladesh (TRNB), organise a seminar on NEIR without questioning its risks or relevance? Why provide a platform for BTRC officials and industry representatives to promote NEIR rather than subject their claims to scrutiny?\n\nKamal Ahmedis consulting editor at The Daily Star.

At a time when many youth suffer from mental health issues, music and sports are two areas which can freshen students' minds and provide them with creative outlets which can be a welcome break from the pressure of more academic subjects.\n\nMusic education is prevalent in Kuwait.

They have revised their primary music curriculum as recently as 2007 to incorporate newer approaches in teaching methodology aimed at improving students' creativity.The quality of public school education in Bangladesh is already alarming and standards fall behind other comparable countries. Making decisions which further take away creativity and critical thinking skills in students, making them more dependent on rote memorisation, can be an unfortunate move which further worsens the quality of our education.This move may also create social inequalities. With many lower middle class and middle class households in Bangladesh choosing to enrol their children in public education, moves like these will further differentiate the schooling experience children receive due to their socioeconomic background.

A divisive move which deepens class divides and deprives our children of a happier school experience which allows them to explore their full potential or imagination cannot be welcomed as a democratic decision. The school curriculum should uphold Bangladesh's culture and art, as that is what unites us all as citizens regardless of social class or personal belief.

Ousted prime minister Hasina, her sister Rehana and their children, including Tulip, absconded to evade trial, it said.\n\nThe commission said in special case no. 18, Tulip was found guilty of influencing her aunt to secure land for her mother and siblings. The prosecution examined 32 witnesses, several of whom testified under oath that Tulip used her influence to have the plot allotted. Their testimonies, along with circumstantial evidence, showed she was \"deeply involved in the illegal process\".\n\nAccording to the statement, such actions constitute abetment under several sections of the Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.\n\nIt added that Tulip obtained a plot in Gulshan by wielding influence over her aunt.\n\nThe ACC said Tulip had also been linked to London properties purchased through offshore companies. It rejected her claim that she was unable to respond to the charges, saying she had the opportunity to attend the trial but declined to appear or appoint representation, leading to her being tried in absentia.\n\nDeposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana and her niece Tulip Siddiq were sentenced in absentia on Monday over corruption in the allocation of Purbachal plots.

        "headline": "Conviction of Tulip: ACC defends trial process in Purbachal plot scam cases",
        "full_news": "The Anti-Corruption Commission has issued a clarification responding to concerns raised in recent media reports about the trial and sentencing of Tulip Siddiq, saying the facts of the case have been \"misrepresented\".\n\nIn its statement last night, the ACC said it conducted a review of all prosecution materials filed against Tulip in the corruption cases involving her and members of the former prime minister's family.\n\nAccording to the case records, each matter involves allegations of corruption relating to the allotment of government plots in the names of Sheikh Hasina, Sheikh Rehana, and their siblings and children. In one pending case, the commission said it appears that Hasina's niece Tulip herself was allotted an additional plot during her aunt's tenure as head of government.\n\nThe ACC said Sheikh Hasina, Sheikh Rehana and their siblings, including Tulip, absconded to evade trial. Of the three cases, the trial of the first has concluded. In Special Case No. 18 of 2025 before Special Tribunal No. 5, Tulip was found guilty of corruption for influencing her aunt to secure land for her mother and siblings.\n\nIt said, the prosecution examined 32 witnesses. Several testified under oath that Tulip, known to be close to Hasina, used her influence to obtain the allotments. The ACC said their testimony, together with circumstantial evidence of plots allotted in the names of Tulip, her mother and her siblings, showed she was \"deeply involved in the illegal process\" of securing the plots.\n\nThe statement said such actions constitute abetment under Sections 161, 163, 164, 165(Ka), 201, 217, 218, 409, and 420 of the Penal Code, read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.\n\nThe ACC added that Tulip herself obtained a plot in Gulshan and later renumbered -- by abusing the influence she wielded over her aunt. The land is located in one of the most expensive areas of Dhaka and had been earmarked for public housing.\n\nThe statement also said Tulip had been linked to a number of London properties purchased through offshore companies. \"This raises a fundamental question: how do individuals in public service acquire the resources necessary to purchase multiple properties and parcels of land in two major world capitals?\" the ACC said.\n\nIt rejected Tulip's assertion that she was unable to respond to the charges, saying she was given the opportunity to attend the trial but declined to appear or be represented, resulting in her being tried in absentia.\n\n\"In light of these facts and circumstances, there is no basis to suggest that she was not involved in corruption or that she is innocent of the charges brought against her,\" the ACC said.\n\nIt is to be noted that deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana, and her niece Tulip Siddiq, a Labour MP in the UK, were sentenced in absentia to varying jail terms over corruption in the allocation of Purbachal plots, on Monday.\n\nHowever, Tulip Siddiq told The Guardian that the ruling \"deserves contempt\" and called the entire process \"flawed and farcical\". She said the outcome of the \"kangaroo court\" was predictable and politically motivated, adding that she would not be distracted from her duties to her constituents.",

        "full_news": "Head coach Peter Butler described SAFF-level football as \"terrible\", stressing that the Bangladesh women's team must regularly compete at a much higher standard if they want to improve.\n\n\"These girls have been used to playing at the SAFF level. SAFF level is terrible. SAFF level is not strong. You've got to compete at the AFC level,\" Butler said after his side went down 2-1 following a spirited display against European outfit Azerbaijan in the final match of the Infinix Tri-Nation Tournament, which also involved Malaysia, at the National Stadium on Tuesday.\n\nButler, however, expressed satisfaction with his players, who failed to register a single point in the Tri-Nation Series organised by the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) as part of preparations for next year's AFC Women's Asian Cup in Australia.\n\n\"We played against a very strong team who, in all fairness, get lots of funding, have professional leagues, and have great facilities. Before the game, I told the girls that all I ask is to make a game of it… We didn't have enough quality at the end of the day, but that's because we don't have a professional league. Until Bangladesh puts a professional league in place, you're going to have huge issues, big problems, irrespective of who is in charge or coaching.\n\n\"They've shown tonight that they have many players competing across Eastern Europe -- Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, etc. And that's the level we need to be playing at regularly, and the level we need to be competing with if we want to improve,\" he added.\n\nBangladesh have been drawn with China, North Korea, and Uzbekistan in the AFC Women's Asian Cup, and Butler is focused on reaching that level by facing stronger opponents in the buildup.\n\nAsked about the preparation plan for the next three months, Butler said, \"I would play stronger opposition right up to the tournament, if we could. And if we got beaten, as long as we learn from it, it doesn't matter whether I'm in charge or someone else is.\"\n\nThe women in red and green performed comparatively better than they had against Malaysia, showing intent throughout the match and challenging Azerbaijan at times.\n\n\"It was a different game against Azerbaijan. Malaysia defended deep. But you've got to remember you're playing against a team with better quality -- they had more quality than Malaysia. I thought we played better, more controlled football against Malaysia. Tonight, maybe we rushed it a little bit, but I'm proud of the girls. All I wanted is for them to give their all like they did against Malaysia, and most importantly, make a game of it. And they did. They took it to the brink. They conceded a sloppy goal six to seven minutes from time, and the first goal was also sloppy,\" Butler said.\n\nAzerbaijan coach Asgarov Slyasat praised Bangladesh's approach, saying they took the game seriously and posed challenges in the first 15 minutes.\n\nSlyasat, however, believes Bangladesh lag in physicality, fitness, age, and experience compared to the Azerbaijan players, many of whom have been playing abroad for a long time and are therefore far more experienced than the youthful Bangladesh side.",

On good days, they earn Tk 1,000 to Tk 5,000, enough to sustain the household.\n\nTheir bond with music spans generations.\n\nHelal learned to sing in his youth from folk musician Shahnoor Shah of Bhatpara. By age 10 or 12, he was performing publicly, later teaching his children, who now sing with him at the municipal stage.\n\nHelal said the November 26 obstruction came from protesters demonstrating over Baul Abul Sarkar's punishment.\n\nThe sudden loss of income pushed the family into hardship, sparking widespread public concern once the matter was reported in the media.\n\nThe family resumed singing today following assurances from former Brahmanbaria municipal mayor and former district BNP president Hafizur Rahman Molla Kachi.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Kachi said, \"Helal Mia, who is visually impaired, told me about the incident. I asked him to return to the open-air stage for singing.\"\n\nHelal, however, expressed deep gratitude to Kachi for helping resolve the situation.\n\nMd Obaidur Rahman, additional superintendent (administration and finance) in the police, said police were not aware of any obstruction and had received no complaint regarding the matter.",

        "full_news": "Health services and vaccination programmes are facing disruption as several sections of medical professionals continue their demonstrations to press home their separate demands.\n\nGovernment nurses, medical technologists, pharmacists, and health assistants have been holding separate programmes and demonstrations for the last two weeks and have threatened to intensify them, indicating further disruption in healthcare services.\n\nVaccination of children across the country came to a near halt as several thousand health assistants began a sit-in at the Central Shaheed Minar on Saturday to realise their demands.\n\nThe demonstrators said they have long been making their demands and were forced to take to the streets as the authorities did not pay heed to them.\n\nABM Abu Hanif, director (administration) of Director General of Health Services (DGHS), however, said they were in favour of most of the demands, and the implementation of many of them is already underway.\n\nBut the agitating health workers are not willing to allow the time needed; instead, they have been demonstrating in violation of their service rules and causing suffering to the service seekers.\n\n\"The health ministry is working to resolve the issues,\" he told The Daily Star yesterday.\n\nHealth assistants are frontline public health workers, especially in rural and hard-to-reach areas. They conduct routine vaccination sessions and register newborn children, among other responsibilities.\n\nAll the activities have been suspended since the health assistants began the strike on Saturday, Hasanul Mahmud, assistant director of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation under the DGHS, told this correspondent.\n\nReplying to a question, he said they would arrange extra sessions, once the health assistants withdraw their demonstration, to make up for the losses caused by the protest.\n\nSeveral thousand health assistants took position in front of the DGHS office around 9:00am yesterday as they saw no progress on their demands.\n\nSeveral mid-level officials from DGHS asked them to hold talks, but they refused and said they would only sit with the health adviser, said Fazlul Haque Chowdhury, member secretary of the Bangladesh Health Assistant Association Central Coordination Council.\n\nThe association has long been demanding amendments to the recruitment rules, upgrading their entry post to grade-14 instead of grade-16, removal of salary discrimination, and the granting of technical status, among their six-point demand.\n\nOn November 23, the organisation announced that it would go for work abstention if its demands were not met by November 28.\n\nAs per the previous announcement, two other key professional groups in public health services -- medical technologists and pharmacists -- are supposed to enforce a four-hour (8:00am to 12:00pm) work abstention today.\n\nOn November 25, they, under the banner of the Medical Technologist and Pharmacist 10th Grade Implementation Council, announced a series of programmes to raise their entry post to grade-10 instead of grade-11.\n\nThey observed a two-hour work abstention on Sunday, leaving many patients without services. Medical technologists conduct laboratory tests that help doctors diagnose and treat patients, while pharmacists supply prescribed medicines at hospitals.\n\nRipon Shikdar, coordinator of the council, said around 13,000 medical technologists work at government medical facilities.\n\nThe health ministry has, on several occasions, assured them that their demand would be met, but it has yet to be implemented, he said.\n\n\"We will go for a full-day complete shutdown at all government and private hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres, and health education institutions on Thursday unless our demand is met.\"\n\nRipon added that they held separate meetings with secretaries of health and public administration ministries yesterday, and both assured them that their demand would be met. \"But we are not convinced and will therefore move forward with tomorrow's [today's] programme,\" he told this newspaper last night.\n\nAt a rally on November 23, Bangladesh Nurses Association and Bangladesh Midwifery Society announced programmes to press home their eight-point demand, including scrapping the reported plan to abolish the Directorate General of Nursing and Midwifery.\n\nThey staged two-hour demonstrations on November 26, 27, and 30 at medical facilities across the country, hampering healthcare services.\n\nThey were supposed to go for a \"complete shutdown\" at all medical facilities yesterday, but it was postponed after the health ministry called a meeting over their demand, said Asaduzzaman Jewel, secretary general of the Bangladesh Nurses Association.\n\nTalking to The Daily Star last night, Shariful Islam, president of the association, said they had a fruitful meeting with the health secretary. \"We will set our next course of action after holding a meeting tonight [last night].\"\n\nThe Daily Star could not reach Health Secretary Saidur Rahman for comments, as he did not respond to our phone calls.",

        "full_news": "The Election Commission is likely to finalise its decision on announcing the schedules for the upcoming 13th national election and the referendum, both to be held on the same day, at its meeting scheduled for December 7.\n\nAt that meeting, the commission will also discuss extending voting hours by one hour and increasing the number of secret chambers at polling booths to ensure smoother voting.\n\n\"The plan is to add half an hour at both the beginning and end of the voting,\" Election Commissioner Anwarul Islam Sarkar told this newspaper yesterday.\n\n\"We are considering doubling the chambers in some cases if possible. We will finalise it in the meeting on the 7th,\" he added.\n\nCurrently, voting in the national elections takes place from 8:00am to 4:00pm without a break.\n\nFor the election planned in February, the EC has designated 42,761 polling centres and 244,739 booths nationwide: one centre for every 3,000 voters, with one booth for every 500 male voters and 400 female voters.\n\nEC officials noted that these calculations apply only to the parliamentary election. Since both the election and referendum will be held simultaneously, the number of booths will need to be increased, even if the number of centres remains the same, since casting two ballots will take longer.\n\nAnwarul hinted that the election schedule is likely to be announced sometime between December 8 and 14 this year and that the national polls and referendum are likely to take place between February 8 and 14 next year.\n\nEC officials explained that voting days are usually chosen with weekly holidays in mind—either the first working day of the week (Sunday) or the last (Thursday). Based on past practice, the EC Secretariat will propose multiple dates, from which the commission will select one.\n\nOf the last 12 elections, the 2nd, 10th, 11th, and 12th were held on Sundays. The 8th and 9th were held on Mondays. The 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th were held on Wednesdays, and the 4th and 6th were held on Thursdays.\n\nMeanwhile, the EC and the state machinery are going ahead with preparations for the February polls. The EC published the final voter list, confirmed the registration of two new political parties, and launched a mobile app to help expatriate Bangladeshis register as voters.\n\nThe government has made amendments to the Representation of the People Order, 1972, in line with the EC's recommendations. The commission also made changes to the electoral code of conduct for the parties and candidates.\n\nOn September 4, the EC finalised the delimitation of 300 constituencies, redrawing the boundaries of 46 parliamentary seats in 16 different districts across the country.\n\nThe EC also held meetings with parties as well as other stakeholders, including former election officials, observers, civil society representatives, university teachers, and journalists.\n\nThe commission has updated guidelines for journalists, observers, and polling station setup. Trainers are now being readied to guide election officials. Final selection and training will begin after the election schedule is announced.",

        "headline": "Basu Bahini: The fierce guerrilla force in the haor",
        "full_news": "Fifty-three years after Bangladesh's independence, countless stories remain untold. Part 2 of this 12-part series tells the story of the fearsome Basu Bahini of Kishoreganj.\n\nIn the wide waters of the Kishoreganj haor, where the tall grasses stand like watchmen, an unlikely guerrilla force rose during Bangladesh's Liberation War under the leadership of Abdul Motalib Basu, once the feared \"Bhorsa Dakat\". His band, later known as the Basu Bahini, began with his own followers and grew to more than 300 fighters across nine upazilas in three districts.\n\nSome of their stories are documented in Jahangir Alam Jahan's Kishoreganj Jelar Muktijuddher Itihas, and in the memories of those who lived beside them. In May this year, this reporter travelled through five upazilas in Kishoreganj and Habiganj and spoke to at least 25 fighters and villagers who once sought shelter under their protection.\n\nBefore the war, Basu had been a notorious robber, jailed in Kishoreganj in several murder cases. When students and youths broke open the prison at the end of March, he returned to Gurui village in Nikli and rallied his men and any local willing to fight.\n\nAfter the Pakistani army captured Bajitpur on April 18, 1971, Sangram Committee member Prof Yakub Mia summoned Basu to his home in Chhaychira.\n\nBahini member Abdul Wahab, 77, told The Daily Star that Prof Yakub initially hesitated to trust a former dacoit, but confidence grew. The first camp was set up at the Gurui Union Parishad with 45 fighters.\n\nIn May, the Basu Bahini trained for two weeks at Ujlabar camp in Belabo, Narsingdi, then based themselves in a house in Hilchia near Gurui. They opened their operations by killing two notorious collaborators in the haor, according to the book.\n\nFrom there, actions unfolded in quick succession: the June 25 attack on Bajitpur Police Station; the July 20 operation on Nikli Thana; the battles at Sealdah crematorium on July 25 and Manikkali Duilja Bridge on July 30; and the National Bank operation in Bajitpur.\n\nBefore dawn on June 25, hundreds of Basu Bahini fighters surrounded the Bajitpur Police Station, where Pakistani forces and Razakars took shelter.\n\nAbdul Hekim, 82, a member of the Basu Bahini, recalled, \"A seven-hour battle raged until the Razakars and police ran out of ammunition and fled through a tunnel to the OC's house, where they were captured.\" Crowds then stormed the market, seized the captives, and beat them to death.\n\nAround the same time, Basu's men blew up the railway bridge between Gachihata and Manikkhali in Katiadi to disrupt Pakistani movements.\n\nIn mid-July, Basu's men escorted the wife and children of war-time acting President Syed Nazrul Islam from Nikli towards India. Razakars ambushed them at Ratari Haor in Sunamganj, but eight Razakars were killed in a counter attack and one was captured, said Wahab.\n\nOn September 6, disoriented by the Bahini's repeated strikes, Pakistani soldiers and Razakars entered Gurui by launch, looting and burning homes. After villagers alerted the Hilchia camp, 20–25 fighters ambushed them, killing five soldiers, said Yusuf Ali, another member of the Bahini.\n\n\"When our fighters ran out of ammunition and withdrew, the army torched homes and massacred at least 25 villagers in Gurui Bazar. As they retreated by launch, 40–50 of our men attacked again, killing 15–16 Pakistani soldiers and Razakars. After that, Gurui, Hilchia, and nearby villages became liberated areas,\" Yusuf said.\n\nOther Basu Bahini battles included the Bagamara Bridge operation; attacks at Nikli and Madan thanas; attacks on Pakistani trawlers at Chhatirchar; the Sararchar train operation; the killing of Razakars in Ashtagram; and the eventual liberation of Kishoreganj town.\n\nTheir most decisive fight came at Nikli Thana, where 30 Pakistani soldiers died and four freedom fighters were martyred. Pakistani troops, police, and Al-Badr men had strengthened the thana and the adjacent Razakar base at Nikli Gorachand High School. On October 14, Razakars surrounded a reconnaissance team; when the Bahini intervened, the Razakars withdrew.\n\n\"Basu then planned a full assault with four companies. They encircled the station on October 15–16 and from October 17 began attacking identified positions,\"Freedom fighter Wahab said.\n\nOn October 19, with the Pakistanis exhausted and several freedom fighters dead, the Bahini launched a final assault. The Pakistani troops fled toward Sunamganj, leaving more than 30 bodies behind.\n\nBy early December, as Pakistani forces retreated from Kishoreganj to Mymensingh, the Basu Bahini attacked their stronghold at Kaliachapra Sugar Mill on December 11. Razakars ambushed them near the WAPDA office, killing several fighters.\n\nRafique Master, 73, who fought alongside the Bahini, said they surrounded Kishoreganj town with other regional fighters and battled for four days from December 12. Several freedom fighters and more than 50 Razakars were killed. \"The Razakars and Al-Badr surrendered on December 17,\" he said.\n\nThe Basu Bahini surrendered their weapons to the Kishoreganj subdistrict administration on January 26, 1972.\n\nSAKINA BEGUM: COOK TO SPY\n\nAmong them was Sakhina Begum. She spoke with The Daily Star just two weeks before she died in June 2025 at the age of 93. She began as a cook in the Hilchia camp and then became a spy for the freedom fighters. Detained twice by the Pakistan army and Razakars, but she escaped both times.\n\n\"After my nephew, freedom fighter Matiur Rahman, was killed at Nikli, I took a vow to fight. When three Razakars were captured in Bajitpur, I brought them to Hilchia camp and hacked all three to death,\" she said.\n\nShe said she later killed two more Razakars with the same dagger, now kept at the Liberation War Museum.\n\nTHE BASU FAMILY\n\nDespite 25 criminal cases, Basu received general amnesty for his wartime role. He joined the Awami League in 1972, but a faction rejected him. Later that year, members of that faction shot him and drowned his body in the Ghorautra River.\n\nHe left behind his wife, two sons, and a daughter. Today, his ailing wife and daughter live in a small tin house in Gurui; all family property was seized after his death. When this reporter visited in May, his wife lay on the floor on a torn kantha. His daughter, Rahima Khatun, 58, widowed within three years of marriage, works as a domestic help in her village while also caring for her mother.\n\nBasu's son Nazrul, 60, used the freedom fighter's allowance to build his own tin house. The mother and daughter said they do not receive any monthly allowance either.\n\nResearcher Sukhen Dutta, who has spent 11 years studying the Basu Bahini, said: \"The Liberation War transformed a notorious robber into a man wholly devoted to his motherland. The contribution of the Basu Bahini in the haor battles deserves to be written in golden letters.\"",

        "headline": "How salinity sank Satkhira farmers' harvests",
        "full_news": "The struggle to cope with rising salinity, depleting sweet water, and diminishing livelihoods continues on the frontlines of climate change in the rural southwest. This is the 4th of a 5-part series.\n\nOn the outer edge of the Sundarbans, Abdul Majed Sarkar once found solace in his modest patch of land. The four-bigha plot he inherited from his father had long been his anchor -- a fertile stretch in Satkhira's Burigoalini union where he grew rice for decades.\n\n\"The landscape used to be lush green, extending as far as the eye could see,\" recalls the 84-year-old, his voice tinged with nostalgia.\n\n\"Paddy would sway in the wind. The harvest was enough to feed our family, and we still had some left to sell.\"\n\nBut by the mid-1990s, Majed and his neighbours began noticing a subtle yet troubling shift. Rice plants withered, yields fell, and shrimp farming began taking over neighbouring fields.\n\nToday, the land where Majed once grew rice lies submerged beneath a murky, grey-green sheet of water. It has been transformed into a shrimp enclosure, locally known as gher.\n\n\"Initially, there were only a few ponds. But slowly, they spread. I tried growing rice for six or seven more years, but eventually, I had to give up. The land changed, and we had to adapt,\" Majed says, gazing out from his home in Paschim Porakatla village of Shyamnagar upazila.\n\nThe once-thriving rice fields and freshwater fish farms of Satkhira's coastal plains, crisscrossed by rivers and canals, are disappearing amid an advancing tide of salinity, driven by rising seas, cyclones, tidal surges, and a changing climate.As harvests dwindled and profits shrank, shrimp cultivation crept in, promising quick returns but deepening the crisis. Vast stretches of farmland, ponds, and canals are now saturated with salt, forcing thousands of farmers like Majed to abandon traditional crops.According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Satkhira, comprising seven upazilas, covers an area of 3.81 lakh hectares, of which 2.26 lakh hectares are arable land.At least 1.53 lakh hectares, including 73,000 hectares used for shrimp farming, have been affected by varying degrees of salinity.Salinity levels in both soil and water fluctuate with the change of seasons, rising in the dry months and dropping during the monsoon.A recent report by the Satkhira office of Soil Resources Development Institute shows soil salinity has increased sharply over the past five years.Take Shyamnagar, for instance. Salinity in the soil was measured at 3.9 deciSiemens per metre (dS/m) in the upazila in January 2021 against the tolerable limit of 6 dS/m. It doubled to 8.12 dS/m in the same month this year, according to the report.If soil salinity levels exceed 4 dS/m, crop yields begin to fall.Farmers say last year's harvest was severely hit by salinity.\"I cultivated rice on 20 bighas of land. But excessive salinity ruined about 20 percent of the crop, resulting in a significant financial loss,\" said Mohammad Alauddin, a farmer in Kaliganj.Rice cultivation in Satkhira has been in decline over the past 15 years, according to data from the DAE Satkhira office.Aus acreage plunged from 12,265 hectares in 2010 to 6,610 hectares last year. Aman cultivation also shrank, dropping from 104,820 hectares to 88,650 hectares over the same period. However, Boro acreage saw a rise, edging up from 73,640 hectares to 80,795 hectares.PUSH TOWARDS SHRIMP FARMINGBranded as \"white gold\", shrimp farming took root in the 1980s in three southwestern districts -- Satkhira, Khulna and Bagerhat. With hopes of high profits and export earnings, farmers embraced farming of tiger shrimp (bagda) and giant freshwater prawns (golda), sparking an unplanned boom that reshaped the landscape.Wealthy and politically influential landowners started carving out massive ponds, often breaching embankments to draw saline river water into the fields. Soon, vast stretches of farmland were converted into ghers in Shyamnagar, Kaliganj, Debhata and Assasuni of Satkhira.With shrimp enclosures multiplying, saline water seeped into fields. Freshwater ecosystems that sustained generations of farmers began collapsing. As repeated attempts to grow crops failed and the lure of quick income grew stronger, many farmers switched to shrimp farming.\"As plot after plot was turned into shrimp enclosures, I simply could not help but shift to aquaculture,\" said Akbar Hossain from Paschim Singhortoli village.A septuagenarian from Burigoalini said that wealthy locals bought -- and in some cases grabbed -- land and water bodies for ghers.Repeated cyclones and tidal surges over the last couple of decades worsened the crisis, breaching embankments and inundating fields with saline water. In the aftermath, many struggled to grow crops and turned to shrimp farming instead.\"We were badly hit by cyclone Aila in 2009 when my land had been submerged for months. Then, cyclone Amphan made things worse. I started shrimp farming by taking loans, just to survive,\" said Anwar Hossain, a resident of Pratapnagar in Shyamnagar upazila.Women have been among the worst affected. Many who once planted, weeded and harvested paddies now collect shrimp fry in brackish waters or work inside ghers, often suffering skin diseases and waterborne illnesses.With aquatic diseases in shrimp farms leading to heavy losses and debts, many farmers wish to return to rice cultivation, but salinity has made their lands unfit for growing crops.\"We thought shrimp would bring prosperity, but repeated aquatic diseases wiped out our savings. I want to grow rice again, but the soil is no longer suitable for the crop,\" said Abidul Islam from Shyamnagar.A RAY OF HOPEYet, there are signs of resilience. Farmers in some parts of the coastal belt are experimenting with salt-tolerant rice and vegetables -- crop varieties that can withstand high salinity.\"We lost hope when our fields became too saline for growing paddy. With salt-tolerant rice varieties, we can now at least grow something again,\" said Anwar Hossain, a farmer in Kaliganj.But many farmers still lack awareness and support.Saiful Islam, deputy director of the DAE in Satkhira, said they are promoting crop diversification and supporting farmers with adaptive techniques.\"During the Boro season [from October to March], we advise farmers to plant early so that crops are exposed to salinity for a shorter period,\" he said.When salinity levels drop after the monsoon, the department recommends planting resilient rice varieties such as BRRI dhan-67, 93, 97 and BINA dhan-10.Farmers are also encouraged to dig small ponds beside fields to store freshwater for irrigation during the dry months. \"We have been trying to boost yields along the fringes of the ghers during the Boro season,\" Saiful said.Experts say climate-resilient agriculture -- from introducing new varieties of salt-tolerant seeds to re-excavating freshwater canals -- is essential to help the farmers in the region recover.They believe the crisis can be partly managed through timely information, training, and widespread adoption of salt-tolerant crops.[Our Satkhira correspondent contributed to this report]\n\nThe once-thriving rice fields and freshwater fish farms of Satkhira's coastal plains, crisscrossed by rivers and canals, are disappearing amid an advancing tide of salinity, driven by rising seas, cyclones, tidal surges, and a changing climate.\n\nAs harvests dwindled and profits shrank, shrimp cultivation crept in, promising quick returns but deepening the crisis.

        "full_news": "Transparency International Bangladesh Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman thinks that bringing peace to the hilly regions and ensuring the rights of indigenous people is mainly in the hands of the army.\n\n\"The hilly region is under the authority of the Bangladesh Army. They are the ones who can establish peace,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the people expect the army to take visible steps towards peace. \"If they move away from the ongoing divide and rule situation and take real steps based on facts and events, then it is possible for them to establish peace.\"\n\nHe made the remarks at the TIB office in the capital's Dhanmondi after the launch of a research report titled, \"Inclusion of Indigenous Communities in Social Safety Programmes: Challenges of Good Governance and Ways Forward.\"\n\nResponding to a question from a journalist, Iftekharuzzaman said he has already informed the government clearly and in writing that this is the time for the army to reflect on its role.\n\n\"The Bangladesh Army has proudly played a role in peacekeeping missions in 169 countries. The people of the country, including me, are proud of this. At this moment, the Bangladesh Army is working in at least 10 countries to help establish peace and is making significant contributions that have received international recognition.\"\n\nHe questioned why the army cannot establish peace in a part of Bangladesh that is already under its own authority. He said the army should answer this question itself.\n\n\"It is an opportunity for the army to improve its national and international acceptance, credibility, and respect.\"\n\nThe TIB executive director added that the army is capable of bringing peace to the hill tracts on its own initiative, even without support from the government.\n\n\"I believe that if the army has the will, all parts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord can be implemented. No past government has been able to do this. Even the most powerful and authoritarian government that ruled the country for the last 15 years could not do it.\"\n\nThe authority necessary for establishing peace will only work if the army decides to make real efforts, Iftekharuzzaman added.\n\nTIB Research fellow Razia Sultana presented the research findings at the event on the challenges indigenous communities face in accessing social safety net programmes.\n\nAccording to the study, indigenous people in both the plains and the hilly areas often remain excluded from government support schemes.\n\nMany do not get accurate information about available services and face discrimination, corruption, and administrative complexities.\n\nThe report said language barriers, poor communication facilities, mobile network problems, and limited internet access cause serious difficulties.\n\nIn many places, officials do not follow proper rules while selecting beneficiaries, leaving vulnerable indigenous households without assistance.\n\nThe report added that poverty, land loss, political influence, social inequality, and geographical isolation further increase vulnerability.\n\nMany families lack the required documents, such as national identity cards or birth certificates, which prevent them from enrolling in social safety programmes.\n\nSome applicants face harassment, delays, and demands for bribes. Others avoid applying because they fear discrimination or feel discouraged by repeated refusals.\n\nTIB, the Bangladesh chapter of the Germany-based global anti-graft watchdog, recommended ensuring fair access to services, improving coordination among government bodies, increasing the use of information technology, and raising awareness among local officials.\n\nThe organisation urged the government to include indigenous voices in decision-making, strengthen monitoring, and ensure transparency.\n\nIt also called for long-term planning to make social safety schemes more inclusive and effective.",

        "full_news": "Annual examinations at nearly 700 government secondary schools will resume today after two days as the teachers called off theirwork abstentionlast night.\n\nThe two-day strike affected more than 5.5 lakh students and disrupted annual and pre‑test examinations in almost all districts.\n\nIn a statement, the Bangladesh Government Secondary Teachers' Association said the work abstention was being temporarily withdrawn in the interest of students.\n\nAnnual examinations are crucial for students' academic progress and the uncertainty surrounding the tests had caused significant stress for students and parents.\n\n\"Recognising this pressure, and out of a sense of responsibility, we have decided to return to academic duties. We believe it is one of our key responsibilities to safeguard students' futures and bring their academic life back to its normal course,\" it added.\n\nThe association expects the authorities to take swift and effective steps to realise their legitimate demands, so that academic activities do not face further disruption.\n\nTeachers have been demanding upgrading assistant teachers to grade 9 under the BCS (General Education) cadre by establishing a Directorate of Secondary Education, resolving pending promotions and postings, granting due timescale and selection grade benefits, and restoring advance increments withdrawn in 2015.\n\nThe teachers continued their boycott for the second day yesterday, despite three separate letters from the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) instructing schools to continue examinations \"under any circumstances\".\n\nThe letters also asked regional officials to identify and report teachers obstructing exams.\n\nDespite the move, most schools did not hold examinations yesterday.\n\nThe government had toughened its stance on Monday evening, when Education Adviser CR Abrar told BSS that halting examinations violated service rules.\n\nCalling the use of students' exams as leverage \"unacceptable\", he said the demand for grade 9 was neither part of teachers' job terms.\n\nEven so, the nationwide teachers' strike continued.\n\nAll 29 government secondary schools in Noakhali, Feni and Lakshmipur suspended examinations for the second day yesterday.\n\nStudents arriving for Bangla, General Science and Mathematics papers found classrooms locked and staffrooms empty.\n\nSidratul Muntaha and Bibi Fatema, class-V students at Noakhali Government Girls' High School, said their exams began on November 25 and four tests were completed.\n\n\"Today we came to sit for the Bangla exam, but we saw a lock on the classroom door. The teachers are not here. Now we are going back home,\" they said.\n\nGuardians expressed frustration, saying repeated uncertainty had discouraged children from studying.\n\nSeveral parents said they were forced to take leave from work after bringing their children to school only to find the exams were postponed again.\n\n\"Our children stop studying as soon as they hear the exam is not happening,\" said Jannatul Ferdous, a guardian at the school.\n\nAfter keeping private tutors all year and bearing school expenses, the children's annual exam is not being held, she said.\n\n\"This is unacceptable. We are not willing to accept any games being played with the students' future between the teachers and the government,\" she said.\n\nThere is no point in suspending the children's exams to achieve demands, said Humayun Kabir, another guardian.\n\n\"If you want to realise your demands, protest in the political arena,\" he said.\n\nMd Jahangir Alam, acting headmaster of Noakhali Government Girls' High School, said the institution halted all exams from Monday \"in line with the national programme\".\n\nExaminations across all government secondary schools in Bandarban were suspended. At Bandarban Government Girls' High School, class-X students who arrived to sit for their General Science exam were sent back.\n\nPrimary schools are also affected as teachers continued their boycotts.\n\nHowever, teachers there are divided in their approach. One group of government primary school teachers under the banner of the Primary Teachers' Demand Implementation Council continued their full‑day work abstention yesterday while keeping annual examinations suspended.\n\nThey began their movement with three demands, including placement in grade 10, but later suspended the programme after assurances were given that they would be placed in grade 11.\n\nMeanwhile, another alliance has given the government time until Wednesday.\n\nThe Primary Assistant Teachers' Organisation Unity Council warned that if demands are not met, schools across the country will be locked down from Thursday.\n\nTheir three‑point demand includes raising the pay scale to grade 10, resolving complexities in obtaining higher grades after 10 and 16 years and ensuring 100 percent departmental promotion to head teacher posts.\n\nThe Directorate of Primary Education has asked all officials to ensure exams continue and warned of action against any teacher failing to conduct tests properly.",

        "full_news": "BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman's decision to return home from London depends on Khaleda Zia's condition and the possibility of taking her abroad for treatment.\n\n\"If Khaleda Zia's health condition remains unchanged, Tarique Rahman will return to Bangladesh soon,\" BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir was quoted in a post on the party's verified Facebook page last night.\n\nTo provide further support to the medical board overseeing Khaleda's treatment, two additional teams of specialist doctors -- one from the United Kingdom and another from China -- are expected to arrive today, according to the BNP media cell.\n\nHer personal physician, AZM Zahid Hossain, yesterday said Khaleda is able to continue receiving treatment, or, as he phrased it, \"she is able to maintain her treatment\".\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside Evercare Hospital in the afternoon, Zahid said Khaleda is not yet fit to travel, and any decision to take her abroad for treatment will depend on the medical board's assessment.\n\nSpecialists from the UK, the USA, China, and Bangladesh are currently overseeing her care, said Zahid, expressing hope for her recovery.\n\nThe BNP chief was admitted to Evercare on November 23 after being diagnosed with infections in her heart and lungs.\n\nShe is also suffering from pneumonia and is currently receiving treatment in the hospital's Coronary Care Unit (CCU).\n\nThe 80-year-old former prime minister has long been battling multiple health complications, including liver cirrhosis, arthritis, diabetes, and issues affecting her kidneys, lungs, heart, and eyes. She has a pacemaker and has previously undergone stent implants in her heart.\n\nPREP FOR TREATMENT ABROAD\n\nAt the briefing, Zahid noted that the BNP has made all necessary preparations to take Khaleda overseas if required.\n\nHe mentioned that many governments and heads of state have extended support.\n\nParty sources said China has agreed to provide an air ambulance and has also offered to take her to the country for treatment.\n\nVisiting physicians have already consulted with Khaleda's medical board, and a decision may be made on advanced treatment abroad after doctors from the UK give their advice.\n\nHer family members, including Tarique and Zubaida Rahman, have been in close contact with the doctors.\n\nTARIQUE'S RETURN\n\nParty sources said Tarique will wait for the medical board's decision before finalising his plan to return to the country.\n\nTarique may choose not to return to Dhaka immediately if Khaleda's condition eventually becomes stable enough for air travel to London.\n\nBefore Khaleda's health deteriorated, Tarique had planned to return after the announcement of the polls schedule.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain yesterday said the government has no specific information about Tarique's return, as he has yet to request a \"travel pass\".\n\n\"It will be issued as soon as he asks for it,\" Touhid said while talking to reporters in the capital.\n\nRegarding security concerns for Tarique, Home Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said the home ministry is ready to provide special protection to anyone who requires it.\n\n'AVOID RUMOURS'\n\nTalking to the reporters, Zahid, on behalf of Khaleda's family and the party, urged everyone not to pay attention to or spread any rumours about her health.\n\nHe also appealed to journalists to remain patient, saying, \"You have stood by us... With your support and by the grace of Allah, Madam Khaleda Zia will recover.\"\n\nZahid said only he and party leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi are authorised to brief the media on Khaleda's health.\n\n\"I request everyone not to listen to statements from anyone else about her condition, as that only fuels rumours.\"\n\nSSF PROTECTION\n\nMembers of the Special Security Force (SSF) and President's Guard Regiment (PGR) were deployed at Evercare Hospital yesterday, a day after the government declared Khaleda a \"very, very important person\" or \"VVIP\".\n\nIn the early hours, police set up a barricade outside the hospital and took positions at the main entrance.\n\nFor security and travel convenience, the government has declared her a \"VVIP\".\n\nWorried and anxious party activists gathered outside the hospital throughout the day yesterday to enquire about Khaleda's health, despite repeated instructions from the BNP not to crowd the area.\n\nJamaat-e-Islami Ameer Shafiqur Rahman was among those who visited the hospital yesterday. After his visit, he said, \"I feel some comfort, as I was able to see her with my own eyes. We are praying for her recovery.\"\n\nPRAYERS\n\nThe advisory council, chaired by Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus, in a special meeting, decided that the government would extend any assistance necessary for Khaleda's treatment.\n\nDuring the meeting yesterday, prayers were offered for Khaleda's recovery, and the nation was urged to pray for her as well.\n\nMeanwhile, at different parts of the country, special prayers were offered for her swift recovery.",

        "headline": "Transitioning from Bank Finance to Capital Market Finance",
        "full_news": "A roundtable titled \"Bridging the Gap: Transitioning from Bank Finance to Capital Market Finance\" was held on 05 November 2025, at The Daily Star Centre, Dhaka. Jointly organised by IDLC Investment Limited and The Daily Star, the dialogue brought together policymakers from the country's financial sector, representatives from regulatory bodies, bank representatives, leaders from the banking and corporate world, and distinguished professionals from the capital market. The Roundtable aimed at deliberating upon potential reduction of Bangladesh's dependency on banks and building a strong, long-term, and investment-capable capital market.\n\nMesbah Uddin AhmedManaging Director of IDLC Investment LimitedKeynote PresenterFor all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.Bangladesh continues to rely overwhelmingly on bank financing, while equity financing remains largely untapped. According to a World Bank survey, only 0.5% of Bangladeshi businesses consider equity as a funding option, compared to 6.9% in India. Our capital market remains shallow, with market capitalisation at just 7.3% of GDP—far below regional peers such as Vietnam (51%) and India (133%). At the same time, fresh industrial term-loan disbursement has surged from Tk 68,000 crore in 2021 to Tk 1.06 lakh crore in 2024, whereas capital-market fund-raising (IPOs and rights) has collapsed from Tk 1,610 crore in 2021 to only Tk 302 crore in 2025.This imbalance has left many firms heavily leveraged, facing rising interest burdens and liquidity stress. Banks, too, are under pressure, with Tk 3.45 trillion in non-performing loans and a capital shortfall of Tk 1.55 lakh crore. Easy access to bank credit—combined with governance weaknesses—has encouraged businesses to depend disproportionately on debt while avoiding the equity market. At the same time, rigid valuation rules, lengthy listing procedures, limited tax incentives, and poor market perception have further discouraged companies from coming to the market.To change this trajectory, greater regulatory flexibility is essential. Streamlined approval processes, digitalised documentation, and meaningful incentives—especially for priority sectors such as garments and agro-industries—can help attract more issuers. Rebuilding investor confidence must remain a policy priority. In parallel, Bangladesh Bank must ensure stronger supervision and prudent leverage across the banking sector to reduce systemic risks.Despite the challenges, investor appetite is clearly strong: recent IPOs have been oversubscribed multiple times. If we address regulatory bottlenecks and strengthen governance, both the equity and bond markets can expand substantially. This will reduce the economy's overdependence on banks and help build a healthier, more balanced financial system for the future.Rashiduzzaman CFA, FRMHead of Investment Banking, IDLC InvestmentsIDLC Investments has reviewed the potential implications of the new BSEC guidelines. While the requirement for stock exchanges to provide feedback within 45–60 days may expedite IPO approvals, it also places significant pressure on exchange capacity as they assume greater responsibilities.The proposed restriction on using IPO proceeds for loan repayment may deter many strong and mature companies from seeking listings. These businesses often pursue IPOs not for new projects, but for strategic reasons such as improving capital structure, strengthening governance, or enhancing brand visibility. Limiting eligibility only to firms with new investment projects would reduce the pipeline of potential issuers, further shrinking the supply of quality stocks in an already shallow market.Although the guideline adopts global valuation practices, the NAV-based pricing cap disadvantages asset-light sectors such as technology and services. Additionally, requiring indicative prices from 75 institutional investors may discourage companies from using the book-building method, while the fixed-price method's limit of BDT 100 crore post-IPO capital effectively shuts out mid- to large-sized firms. The proposed 180-day lock-in for institutional investors adds another layer of deterrence.To create a more enabling environment and broaden the issuer base, we recommend introducing a true Dutch auction mechanism for valuation, which could address several of the challenges currently observed.Rupali Haque ChowdhuryPresident, Bangladesh Association of Publicly Listed Companies (BAPLC)I believe one of the key barriers to market growth lies in the lengthy and cumbersome approval process at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must be streamlined. Many companies remain unprepared for listing due to limited compliance capacity, weak governance, and informal family-based management structures. Our investment-to-GDP ratio has fallen to just 3.67%, the lowest in recent years, reflecting deep investor uncertainty. Moreover, corruption, information leakage, and inconsistent regulations between bodies like the BSEC, NBR, and IMF-driven tax authorities severely erode business confidence. For instance, multinational investors such as Grameenphone have faced policy reversals, discouraging future investment. Automation, digital tracking of files, and a single financial reporting system are critical to ensuring transparency and accountability. If we fail to create a predictable regulatory environment, good companies will stay away. Sustainable growth demands consistency, fairness, and an ecosystem where entrepreneurs can thrive and employment can expand.Reza Uddin AhmadExecutive Director, Finance and Investments, City GroupI have spent decades in corporate banking and investment, and now at City Group, I am guiding our transition toward greater financial transparency and capital market readiness. Following the passing of our founder in 2023, we have diversified into six to seven new industries within the country's emerging economic zones. However, over the past two years, the taka has devalued by nearly 45%, causing significant foreign exchange losses. Banks and NBFIs are facing capital erosion, shrinking their single borrower exposure limits and reducing overall lending capacity. Recognising this, we are preparing for listing, private equity partnerships, and international investments. Our focus now is on strong governance: independent boards, quarterly reporting, and environmental compliance to align with global standards. I believe that as the availability of bank financing declines, the future of corporate growth in Bangladesh will depend on structured reforms, transparency, and active participation in the capital market.Mazeda KhatunPresident, Bangladesh Merchant Bankers Association (BMBA)As a representative of the Merchant Bankers' Association, I believe our merchant banking activities have become far too narrow, limited mostly to IPO management. Merchant banks should play a much broader role in covering valuation, mergers and acquisitions, capital structuring, and advisory services that help companies prepare for listing. Without strengthening this supply side of the capital market, reliance on bank financing will continue, worsening issues like non-performing loans (NPLs). In the past two years, no new IPOs have been launched, leaving many merchant banks with idle capacity. I strongly advocate that Bangladesh Bank, BSEC, and FID jointly develop a framework to integrate merchant banks into national financial planning particularly in financing of national projects, budget formulation, and bond/Sukuk issuance. Proper coordination, automation, and strategic planning can ensure fair valuation and restore investor confidence. Strengthening merchant banks is essential to reduce systemic pressure on banks and build a balanced, sustainable financial ecosystem.Shahidul Islam, CFACEO, VIPB Asset Management CompanyAs an investor, I have observed that although Bangladesh has around 400 listed companies, professional and foreign investors seriously consider only 25 to 30 of them. Many listed entities lack transparency, sound governance, or even genuine corporate structure. In our economy, companies often take \"corporate\" loans backed by personal guarantees, revealing a deep structural flaw. These are not true corporations. The banking system itself suffers from weak enforcement, wilful defaults, and the absence of accountability. History shows this pattern: in the late 1990s, a major conglomerate defaulted on its debenture obligations, yet later raised over Tk 3,000 crore again, without consequence. Unless financial statements become credible and corporate laws are enforced, neither banking nor capital markets can function properly. We must restore integrity, ensure that false reporting is punished, and demand truthful disclosure. Only then will genuine companies emerge and sustainable capital market growth become possible.Saiful IslamPresident of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Brokers AssociationI believe that inconsistent tax policies continue to undermine investor confidence and market stability. When the government reverses tax assurances, for instance, shifting rates from 37% to 42%, it directly hurts minority shareholders and erodes credibility. The banking sector currently provides nearly 98% of total financing, while the capital market contributes only 2%, showing how dependent we remain on debt. Our bond market has stagnated, with most bonds being inter-bank cross-financing, and the mutual fund industry has failed to mature. Without strengthening institutional investors and asset managers, genuine price discovery cannot occur. Meanwhile, many banks face capital shortfalls yet cannot turn to an underdeveloped capital market for recapitalisation. I strongly advocate for a five-to-seven-year transition framework, improved oversight of unlisted companies, and coordinated reform between BSEC, Bangladesh Bank, and NBR to ensure sustainable financial stability.Ahmed Rashid LaliFormer President, DSE Brokers AssociationI see the primary barrier to transitioning from bank financing to the equity market as the speed of access to funds. Entrepreneurs can get financing from banks within 15 to 30 days, but listing on the stock market takes 1–2 years, discouraging participation despite lower equity costs. Under the new law, the Dhaka Stock Exchange is given 45–60 days for draft prospectus review, but this can be shortened using a panel of seven chartered accountants, as we successfully demonstrated during my tenure on the board. By streamlining queries and consolidating documentation, the process can realistically be completed in 45–60 days. Another obstacle is asset registration: for instance, land bought 25 years ago for 500,000 taka in owner's name, now valued at 20 crore, must be formally transferred to the company to satisfy BSEC rules, adding cost and complexity. Without addressing these structural and procedural issues, the transition to the capital market remains stalled.Sabbir Ahmed, FCAPartner, Hoda Vasi Chowdhury & CoI represent the chartered accountant community, and while allegations of fabricated financial statements in the listing process have surfaced, ICAB's Document Verification System (DVS), implemented four years ago, ensures each statement has a unique DVC code, allowing verification of auditors, revenue, and net assets. Our stock market is heavily retail-driven, with institutional investment almost negligible, and many first-generation business owners maintain a sole proprietorship mind-set even in thousand-crore turnover companies, which weakens internal controls and governance. Continuous disclosure obligations deter potential multinational investors, while compliant companies face effective tax rates over 40% due to minimum tax. Policy inconsistency, particularly from the NBR, and the banking system's reliance on personal guarantees instead of verified financial statements further discourage capital market participation, underscoring the need for stronger discipline and systemic reform.Shaheen Iqbal, CFADeputy Managing Director, Brac Bank PLCI believe the capital market is not in competition with banks but must become attractive and efficient to draw investors and issuers. Currently, 90% of total corporate financing comes from banks, highlighting the lack of alternative investment channels. Many client balance sheets are over-leveraged and require restructuring, which banks often provide due to the absence of an active capital market. Trust is critical; fewer than 25 companies are reliably investable, leaving retail investors vulnerable. Initiatives are underway to build the market: we issued the first affordable housing bond, subordinate bonds with 73% non-bank subscription, and social bonds targeting diverse investors. These steps aim to create liquidity in the secondary market and encourage broader participation. Gradually, as the capital market becomes more efficient and trustworthy, it can complement banking finance, reducing over-reliance on banks while supporting structured capital raising for sustainable growth.Istequemal HussainDirector (Debt Management Department), Bangladesh BankI am implying that we have focused on small depositors, not large investors, to maintain confidence in the banking system. Bangladesh Bank always prioritises restructuring weak banks, and many banks that were weak 20 years back have already turned around. Our capacity is steadily improving, supported by the World Bank, IMF, and domestic task forces, including several local experts. Drawing from the Indian experience, where five banks were successfully merged over 20 years without cashing out, we plan to implement share swaps to stabilise the market rather than immediate pay-outs. The current panic is intense, but by prioritising small depositors and executing a structured turnaround plan, we aim to restore trust and gradually strengthen the banking system. Patience and careful planning are essential for lasting results.Mominul IslamChairman, Dhaka Stock ExchangeLet us understand the holistic development of the capital market, emphasising that over-reliance on banks for financing must shift toward a balanced equity and debt market. Our economy is at a crossroads, requiring corporate recapitalisation to enable financial intermediaries and corporates to grow. Current IPO processes are slow due to distrust in financial statements, leading to high compliance costs that exceed global standards. I advocate for alternative approaches, such as bank-guaranteed bonds or asset-backed securities, which can build investor trust and reduce reliance on personal guarantees. For instance, if Brac Bank issues a 25% first-loss guaranteed bond, investors perceive it as safe. Strengthening both debt and equity markets, alongside collaboration between Bangladesh Bank, BSEC, DSE, and NBR, is essential to stabilise the financial ecosystem and ensure long-term market confidence.Md Saifuddin, CFACommissioner, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC)I am focusing on the structural issues of the capital market, emphasising that the transition from bank financing to market-based finance requires addressing deep-rooted incentives and behavioural patterns. Over the past 15-16 years, pervasive incentives and regulatory forbearance have allowed opportunistic firms to dominate, while good companies avoided the market. For instance, 60 merchant banks manage total capital raises of only 300-600 crore taka, reflecting inefficiencies and distorted valuation methods. The market has been shaped by information asymmetry, wealth concentration, and behavioural degeneracy, rather than economic principles. True equity valuation must consider operating capital and earning power, not just asset liquidation values. Protecting minority shareholders and ensuring fair regulation is critical to attract generational capital, build investor trust, and create a functioning, transparent capital market.Tanjim FerdousIn-Charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions, The Daily StarModerator of the SessionAs we conclude today's session, it is clear that Bangladesh must reduce its bank-dependency, with bank loans at 36% of GDP versus capital market capitalisation of 13%. Strengthening the capital market through quality listings, simplified IPO and bond processes, and greater institutional investor participation is essential. Our goal is a balanced, sustainable financial system where banks and markets complement each other. Insights from today's discussion will inform actionable policy recommendations, helping to build investor confidence, deepen liquidity, and support long-term economic growth in Bangladesh.RecommendationsFlexible IPO process: True Dutch auction should be implemented without requiring the need of indicative price. Alternatively, indicative price may be proposed by the Issuer and Issue Manager. Further, valuation Cap at NAV and limiting Post-IPO Paid up capital to 100 crore for fixed price method should be excluded.Use of IPO Proceeds: IPO proceeds should be permitted for debt repayment to attract stronger issuers and strengthen overall market depth.Transition to Market-Driven Valuation Methods: Adopt flexible, international valuation standards that reflect true company potential.Introduce Targeted Tax Incentives for Listing: Provide tax benefits to incentivise private companies to go public.Ensure Enforcement and Accountability: Impose strict consequences for financial misreporting and wilful default to restore trust.\n\nKeynote Presenter\n\nBangladesh continues to rely overwhelmingly on bank financing, while equity financing remains largely untapped.

I strongly advocate for a five-to-seven-year transition framework, improved oversight of unlisted companies, and coordinated reform between BSEC, Bangladesh Bank, and NBR to ensure sustainable financial stability.Ahmed Rashid LaliFormer President, DSE Brokers AssociationI see the primary barrier to transitioning from bank financing to the equity market as the speed of access to funds. Entrepreneurs can get financing from banks within 15 to 30 days, but listing on the stock market takes 1–2 years, discouraging participation despite lower equity costs. Under the new law, the Dhaka Stock Exchange is given 45–60 days for draft prospectus review, but this can be shortened using a panel of seven chartered accountants, as we successfully demonstrated during my tenure on the board. By streamlining queries and consolidating documentation, the process can realistically be completed in 45–60 days. Another obstacle is asset registration: for instance, land bought 25 years ago for 500,000 taka in owner's name, now valued at 20 crore, must be formally transferred to the company to satisfy BSEC rules, adding cost and complexity. Without addressing these structural and procedural issues, the transition to the capital market remains stalled.Sabbir Ahmed, FCAPartner, Hoda Vasi Chowdhury & CoI represent the chartered accountant community, and while allegations of fabricated financial statements in the listing process have surfaced, ICAB's Document Verification System (DVS), implemented four years ago, ensures each statement has a unique DVC code, allowing verification of auditors, revenue, and net assets. Our stock market is heavily retail-driven, with institutional investment almost negligible, and many first-generation business owners maintain a sole proprietorship mind-set even in thousand-crore turnover companies, which weakens internal controls and governance. Continuous disclosure obligations deter potential multinational investors, while compliant companies face effective tax rates over 40% due to minimum tax. Policy inconsistency, particularly from the NBR, and the banking system's reliance on personal guarantees instead of verified financial statements further discourage capital market participation, underscoring the need for stronger discipline and systemic reform.Shaheen Iqbal, CFADeputy Managing Director, Brac Bank PLCI believe the capital market is not in competition with banks but must become attractive and efficient to draw investors and issuers. Currently, 90% of total corporate financing comes from banks, highlighting the lack of alternative investment channels. Many client balance sheets are over-leveraged and require restructuring, which banks often provide due to the absence of an active capital market. Trust is critical; fewer than 25 companies are reliably investable, leaving retail investors vulnerable. Initiatives are underway to build the market: we issued the first affordable housing bond, subordinate bonds with 73% non-bank subscription, and social bonds targeting diverse investors. These steps aim to create liquidity in the secondary market and encourage broader participation. Gradually, as the capital market becomes more efficient and trustworthy, it can complement banking finance, reducing over-reliance on banks while supporting structured capital raising for sustainable growth.Istequemal HussainDirector (Debt Management Department), Bangladesh BankI am implying that we have focused on small depositors, not large investors, to maintain confidence in the banking system. Bangladesh Bank always prioritises restructuring weak banks, and many banks that were weak 20 years back have already turned around. Our capacity is steadily improving, supported by the World Bank, IMF, and domestic task forces, including several local experts. Drawing from the Indian experience, where five banks were successfully merged over 20 years without cashing out, we plan to implement share swaps to stabilise the market rather than immediate pay-outs. The current panic is intense, but by prioritising small depositors and executing a structured turnaround plan, we aim to restore trust and gradually strengthen the banking system. Patience and careful planning are essential for lasting results.Mominul IslamChairman, Dhaka Stock ExchangeLet us understand the holistic development of the capital market, emphasising that over-reliance on banks for financing must shift toward a balanced equity and debt market. Our economy is at a crossroads, requiring corporate recapitalisation to enable financial intermediaries and corporates to grow. Current IPO processes are slow due to distrust in financial statements, leading to high compliance costs that exceed global standards. I advocate for alternative approaches, such as bank-guaranteed bonds or asset-backed securities, which can build investor trust and reduce reliance on personal guarantees. For instance, if Brac Bank issues a 25% first-loss guaranteed bond, investors perceive it as safe. Strengthening both debt and equity markets, alongside collaboration between Bangladesh Bank, BSEC, DSE, and NBR, is essential to stabilise the financial ecosystem and ensure long-term market confidence.Md Saifuddin, CFACommissioner, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC)I am focusing on the structural issues of the capital market, emphasising that the transition from bank financing to market-based finance requires addressing deep-rooted incentives and behavioural patterns. Over the past 15-16 years, pervasive incentives and regulatory forbearance have allowed opportunistic firms to dominate, while good companies avoided the market. For instance, 60 merchant banks manage total capital raises of only 300-600 crore taka, reflecting inefficiencies and distorted valuation methods. The market has been shaped by information asymmetry, wealth concentration, and behavioural degeneracy, rather than economic principles. True equity valuation must consider operating capital and earning power, not just asset liquidation values. Protecting minority shareholders and ensuring fair regulation is critical to attract generational capital, build investor trust, and create a functioning, transparent capital market.Tanjim FerdousIn-Charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions, The Daily StarModerator of the SessionAs we conclude today's session, it is clear that Bangladesh must reduce its bank-dependency, with bank loans at 36% of GDP versus capital market capitalisation of 13%. Strengthening the capital market through quality listings, simplified IPO and bond processes, and greater institutional investor participation is essential. Our goal is a balanced, sustainable financial system where banks and markets complement each other. Insights from today's discussion will inform actionable policy recommendations, helping to build investor confidence, deepen liquidity, and support long-term economic growth in Bangladesh.RecommendationsFlexible IPO process: True Dutch auction should be implemented without requiring the need of indicative price. Alternatively, indicative price may be proposed by the Issuer and Issue Manager. Further, valuation Cap at NAV and limiting Post-IPO Paid up capital to 100 crore for fixed price method should be excluded.Use of IPO Proceeds: IPO proceeds should be permitted for debt repayment to attract stronger issuers and strengthen overall market depth.Transition to Market-Driven Valuation Methods: Adopt flexible, international valuation standards that reflect true company potential.Introduce Targeted Tax Incentives for Listing: Provide tax benefits to incentivise private companies to go public.Ensure Enforcement and Accountability: Impose strict consequences for financial misreporting and wilful default to restore trust.\n\nIDLC Investments has reviewed the potential implications of the new BSEC guidelines. While the requirement for stock exchanges to provide feedback within 45–60 days may expedite IPO approvals, it also places significant pressure on exchange capacity as they assume greater responsibilities.\n\nThe proposed restriction on using IPO proceeds for loan repayment may deter many strong and mature companies from seeking listings. These businesses often pursue IPOs not for new projects, but for strategic reasons such as improving capital structure, strengthening governance, or enhancing brand visibility. Limiting eligibility only to firms with new investment projects would reduce the pipeline of potential issuers, further shrinking the supply of quality stocks in an already shallow market.\n\nAlthough the guideline adopts global valuation practices, the NAV-based pricing cap disadvantages asset-light sectors such as technology and services. Additionally, requiring indicative prices from 75 institutional investors may discourage companies from using the book-building method, while the fixed-price method's limit of BDT 100 crore post-IPO capital effectively shuts out mid- to large-sized firms. The proposed 180-day lock-in for institutional investors adds another layer of deterrence.\n\nTo create a more enabling environment and broaden the issuer base, we recommend introducing a true Dutch auction mechanism for valuation, which could address several of the challenges currently observed.\n\nRupali Haque ChowdhuryPresident, Bangladesh Association of Publicly Listed Companies (BAPLC)I believe one of the key barriers to market growth lies in the lengthy and cumbersome approval process at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must be streamlined. Many companies remain unprepared for listing due to limited compliance capacity, weak governance, and informal family-based management structures. Our investment-to-GDP ratio has fallen to just 3.67%, the lowest in recent years, reflecting deep investor uncertainty. Moreover, corruption, information leakage, and inconsistent regulations between bodies like the BSEC, NBR, and IMF-driven tax authorities severely erode business confidence. For instance, multinational investors such as Grameenphone have faced policy reversals, discouraging future investment. Automation, digital tracking of files, and a single financial reporting system are critical to ensuring transparency and accountability. If we fail to create a predictable regulatory environment, good companies will stay away. Sustainable growth demands consistency, fairness, and an ecosystem where entrepreneurs can thrive and employment can expand.Reza Uddin AhmadExecutive Director, Finance and Investments, City GroupI have spent decades in corporate banking and investment, and now at City Group, I am guiding our transition toward greater financial transparency and capital market readiness. Following the passing of our founder in 2023, we have diversified into six to seven new industries within the country's emerging economic zones. However, over the past two years, the taka has devalued by nearly 45%, causing significant foreign exchange losses. Banks and NBFIs are facing capital erosion, shrinking their single borrower exposure limits and reducing overall lending capacity. Recognising this, we are preparing for listing, private equity partnerships, and international investments. Our focus now is on strong governance: independent boards, quarterly reporting, and environmental compliance to align with global standards. I believe that as the availability of bank financing declines, the future of corporate growth in Bangladesh will depend on structured reforms, transparency, and active participation in the capital market.Mazeda KhatunPresident, Bangladesh Merchant Bankers Association (BMBA)As a representative of the Merchant Bankers' Association, I believe our merchant banking activities have become far too narrow, limited mostly to IPO management. Merchant banks should play a much broader role in covering valuation, mergers and acquisitions, capital structuring, and advisory services that help companies prepare for listing. Without strengthening this supply side of the capital market, reliance on bank financing will continue, worsening issues like non-performing loans (NPLs). In the past two years, no new IPOs have been launched, leaving many merchant banks with idle capacity. I strongly advocate that Bangladesh Bank, BSEC, and FID jointly develop a framework to integrate merchant banks into national financial planning particularly in financing of national projects, budget formulation, and bond/Sukuk issuance. Proper coordination, automation, and strategic planning can ensure fair valuation and restore investor confidence. Strengthening merchant banks is essential to reduce systemic pressure on banks and build a balanced, sustainable financial ecosystem.Shahidul Islam, CFACEO, VIPB Asset Management CompanyAs an investor, I have observed that although Bangladesh has around 400 listed companies, professional and foreign investors seriously consider only 25 to 30 of them. Many listed entities lack transparency, sound governance, or even genuine corporate structure. In our economy, companies often take \"corporate\" loans backed by personal guarantees, revealing a deep structural flaw. These are not true corporations. The banking system itself suffers from weak enforcement, wilful defaults, and the absence of accountability. History shows this pattern: in the late 1990s, a major conglomerate defaulted on its debenture obligations, yet later raised over Tk 3,000 crore again, without consequence. Unless financial statements become credible and corporate laws are enforced, neither banking nor capital markets can function properly. We must restore integrity, ensure that false reporting is punished, and demand truthful disclosure. Only then will genuine companies emerge and sustainable capital market growth become possible.Saiful IslamPresident of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Brokers AssociationI believe that inconsistent tax policies continue to undermine investor confidence and market stability. When the government reverses tax assurances, for instance, shifting rates from 37% to 42%, it directly hurts minority shareholders and erodes credibility. The banking sector currently provides nearly 98% of total financing, while the capital market contributes only 2%, showing how dependent we remain on debt. Our bond market has stagnated, with most bonds being inter-bank cross-financing, and the mutual fund industry has failed to mature. Without strengthening institutional investors and asset managers, genuine price discovery cannot occur. Meanwhile, many banks face capital shortfalls yet cannot turn to an underdeveloped capital market for recapitalisation.

Many client balance sheets are over-leveraged and require restructuring, which banks often provide due to the absence of an active capital market. Trust is critical; fewer than 25 companies are reliably investable, leaving retail investors vulnerable. Initiatives are underway to build the market: we issued the first affordable housing bond, subordinate bonds with 73% non-bank subscription, and social bonds targeting diverse investors. These steps aim to create liquidity in the secondary market and encourage broader participation. Gradually, as the capital market becomes more efficient and trustworthy, it can complement banking finance, reducing over-reliance on banks while supporting structured capital raising for sustainable growth.Istequemal HussainDirector (Debt Management Department), Bangladesh BankI am implying that we have focused on small depositors, not large investors, to maintain confidence in the banking system. Bangladesh Bank always prioritises restructuring weak banks, and many banks that were weak 20 years back have already turned around. Our capacity is steadily improving, supported by the World Bank, IMF, and domestic task forces, including several local experts. Drawing from the Indian experience, where five banks were successfully merged over 20 years without cashing out, we plan to implement share swaps to stabilise the market rather than immediate pay-outs.

Patience and careful planning are essential for lasting results.Mominul IslamChairman, Dhaka Stock ExchangeLet us understand the holistic development of the capital market, emphasising that over-reliance on banks for financing must shift toward a balanced equity and debt market. Our economy is at a crossroads, requiring corporate recapitalisation to enable financial intermediaries and corporates to grow. Current IPO processes are slow due to distrust in financial statements, leading to high compliance costs that exceed global standards. I advocate for alternative approaches, such as bank-guaranteed bonds or asset-backed securities, which can build investor trust and reduce reliance on personal guarantees. For instance, if Brac Bank issues a 25% first-loss guaranteed bond, investors perceive it as safe. Strengthening both debt and equity markets, alongside collaboration between Bangladesh Bank, BSEC, DSE, and NBR, is essential to stabilise the financial ecosystem and ensure long-term market confidence.Md Saifuddin, CFACommissioner, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC)I am focusing on the structural issues of the capital market, emphasising that the transition from bank financing to market-based finance requires addressing deep-rooted incentives and behavioural patterns. Over the past 15-16 years, pervasive incentives and regulatory forbearance have allowed opportunistic firms to dominate, while good companies avoided the market. For instance, 60 merchant banks manage total capital raises of only 300-600 crore taka, reflecting inefficiencies and distorted valuation methods. The market has been shaped by information asymmetry, wealth concentration, and behavioural degeneracy, rather than economic principles. True equity valuation must consider operating capital and earning power, not just asset liquidation values. Protecting minority shareholders and ensuring fair regulation is critical to attract generational capital, build investor trust, and create a functioning, transparent capital market.Tanjim FerdousIn-Charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions, The Daily StarModerator of the SessionAs we conclude today's session, it is clear that Bangladesh must reduce its bank-dependency, with bank loans at 36% of GDP versus capital market capitalisation of 13%. Strengthening the capital market through quality listings, simplified IPO and bond processes, and greater institutional investor participation is essential. Our goal is a balanced, sustainable financial system where banks and markets complement each other. Insights from today's discussion will inform actionable policy recommendations, helping to build investor confidence, deepen liquidity, and support long-term economic growth in Bangladesh.RecommendationsFlexible IPO process: True Dutch auction should be implemented without requiring the need of indicative price. Alternatively, indicative price may be proposed by the Issuer and Issue Manager. Further, valuation Cap at NAV and limiting Post-IPO Paid up capital to 100 crore for fixed price method should be excluded.Use of IPO Proceeds: IPO proceeds should be permitted for debt repayment to attract stronger issuers and strengthen overall market depth.Transition to Market-Driven Valuation Methods: Adopt flexible, international valuation standards that reflect true company potential.Introduce Targeted Tax Incentives for Listing: Provide tax benefits to incentivise private companies to go public.Ensure Enforcement and Accountability: Impose strict consequences for financial misreporting and wilful default to restore trust.\n\nAs a representative of the Merchant Bankers' Association, I believe our merchant banking activities have become far too narrow, limited mostly to IPO management. Merchant banks should play a much broader role in covering valuation, mergers and acquisitions, capital structuring, and advisory services that help companies prepare for listing. Without strengthening this supply side of the capital market, reliance on bank financing will continue, worsening issues like non-performing loans (NPLs). In the past two years, no new IPOs have been launched, leaving many merchant banks with idle capacity. I strongly advocate that Bangladesh Bank, BSEC, and FID jointly develop a framework to integrate merchant banks into national financial planning particularly in financing of national projects, budget formulation, and bond/Sukuk issuance. Proper coordination, automation, and strategic planning can ensure fair valuation and restore investor confidence. Strengthening merchant banks is essential to reduce systemic pressure on banks and build a balanced, sustainable financial ecosystem.\n\nShahidul Islam, CFACEO, VIPB Asset Management CompanyAs an investor, I have observed that although Bangladesh has around 400 listed companies, professional and foreign investors seriously consider only 25 to 30 of them. Many listed entities lack transparency, sound governance, or even genuine corporate structure. In our economy, companies often take \"corporate\" loans backed by personal guarantees, revealing a deep structural flaw. These are not true corporations. The banking system itself suffers from weak enforcement, wilful defaults, and the absence of accountability. History shows this pattern: in the late 1990s, a major conglomerate defaulted on its debenture obligations, yet later raised over Tk 3,000 crore again, without consequence. Unless financial statements become credible and corporate laws are enforced, neither banking nor capital markets can function properly. We must restore integrity, ensure that false reporting is punished, and demand truthful disclosure. Only then will genuine companies emerge and sustainable capital market growth become possible.Saiful IslamPresident of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Brokers AssociationI believe that inconsistent tax policies continue to undermine investor confidence and market stability. When the government reverses tax assurances, for instance, shifting rates from 37% to 42%, it directly hurts minority shareholders and erodes credibility. The banking sector currently provides nearly 98% of total financing, while the capital market contributes only 2%, showing how dependent we remain on debt. Our bond market has stagnated, with most bonds being inter-bank cross-financing, and the mutual fund industry has failed to mature. Without strengthening institutional investors and asset managers, genuine price discovery cannot occur. Meanwhile, many banks face capital shortfalls yet cannot turn to an underdeveloped capital market for recapitalisation. I strongly advocate for a five-to-seven-year transition framework, improved oversight of unlisted companies, and coordinated reform between BSEC, Bangladesh Bank, and NBR to ensure sustainable financial stability.Ahmed Rashid LaliFormer President, DSE Brokers AssociationI see the primary barrier to transitioning from bank financing to the equity market as the speed of access to funds. Entrepreneurs can get financing from banks within 15 to 30 days, but listing on the stock market takes 1–2 years, discouraging participation despite lower equity costs. Under the new law, the Dhaka Stock Exchange is given 45–60 days for draft prospectus review, but this can be shortened using a panel of seven chartered accountants, as we successfully demonstrated during my tenure on the board. By streamlining queries and consolidating documentation, the process can realistically be completed in 45–60 days. Another obstacle is asset registration: for instance, land bought 25 years ago for 500,000 taka in owner's name, now valued at 20 crore, must be formally transferred to the company to satisfy BSEC rules, adding cost and complexity. Without addressing these structural and procedural issues, the transition to the capital market remains stalled.Sabbir Ahmed, FCAPartner, Hoda Vasi Chowdhury & CoI represent the chartered accountant community, and while allegations of fabricated financial statements in the listing process have surfaced, ICAB's Document Verification System (DVS), implemented four years ago, ensures each statement has a unique DVC code, allowing verification of auditors, revenue, and net assets. Our stock market is heavily retail-driven, with institutional investment almost negligible, and many first-generation business owners maintain a sole proprietorship mind-set even in thousand-crore turnover companies, which weakens internal controls and governance. Continuous disclosure obligations deter potential multinational investors, while compliant companies face effective tax rates over 40% due to minimum tax.

Our stock market is heavily retail-driven, with institutional investment almost negligible, and many first-generation business owners maintain a sole proprietorship mind-set even in thousand-crore turnover companies, which weakens internal controls and governance. Continuous disclosure obligations deter potential multinational investors, while compliant companies face effective tax rates over 40% due to minimum tax. Policy inconsistency, particularly from the NBR, and the banking system's reliance on personal guarantees instead of verified financial statements further discourage capital market participation, underscoring the need for stronger discipline and systemic reform.\n\nShaheen Iqbal, CFADeputy Managing Director, Brac Bank PLCI believe the capital market is not in competition with banks but must become attractive and efficient to draw investors and issuers. Currently, 90% of total corporate financing comes from banks, highlighting the lack of alternative investment channels. Many client balance sheets are over-leveraged and require restructuring, which banks often provide due to the absence of an active capital market. Trust is critical; fewer than 25 companies are reliably investable, leaving retail investors vulnerable. Initiatives are underway to build the market: we issued the first affordable housing bond, subordinate bonds with 73% non-bank subscription, and social bonds targeting diverse investors. These steps aim to create liquidity in the secondary market and encourage broader participation. Gradually, as the capital market becomes more efficient and trustworthy, it can complement banking finance, reducing over-reliance on banks while supporting structured capital raising for sustainable growth.Istequemal HussainDirector (Debt Management Department), Bangladesh BankI am implying that we have focused on small depositors, not large investors, to maintain confidence in the banking system. Bangladesh Bank always prioritises restructuring weak banks, and many banks that were weak 20 years back have already turned around. Our capacity is steadily improving, supported by the World Bank, IMF, and domestic task forces, including several local experts. Drawing from the Indian experience, where five banks were successfully merged over 20 years without cashing out, we plan to implement share swaps to stabilise the market rather than immediate pay-outs. The current panic is intense, but by prioritising small depositors and executing a structured turnaround plan, we aim to restore trust and gradually strengthen the banking system.

Our economy is at a crossroads, requiring corporate recapitalisation to enable financial intermediaries and corporates to grow. Current IPO processes are slow due to distrust in financial statements, leading to high compliance costs that exceed global standards. I advocate for alternative approaches, such as bank-guaranteed bonds or asset-backed securities, which can build investor trust and reduce reliance on personal guarantees. For instance, if Brac Bank issues a 25% first-loss guaranteed bond, investors perceive it as safe.

Over the past 15-16 years, pervasive incentives and regulatory forbearance have allowed opportunistic firms to dominate, while good companies avoided the market. For instance, 60 merchant banks manage total capital raises of only 300-600 crore taka, reflecting inefficiencies and distorted valuation methods. The market has been shaped by information asymmetry, wealth concentration, and behavioural degeneracy, rather than economic principles.

Tidal surges in May caused the low-water pontoon and its adjoining road to subside and sink.\n\nDuring a recent visit, this correspondent saw goods-laden trucks waiting for high tide for the ferry to resume operations.\n\n\"Ferry cannot dock during low tide, so we have to wait for high tide, sometimes for as long as five to six hours,\" said Mohammed Sobahan, a truck driver.\n\n\"The ferry service has transformed our connectivity, allowing direct vehicular access to the mainland. However, due to the sunken pontoon, we are unable to reap the benefits fully,\" said Shahidul Islam, a resident and teacher from Sandwip.\n\nMd Yusuf, pontoon-in-charge at Banshbaria ferry ghat, said they can now operate only one trip during high tide.\n\nCurrently, a ferry named Kapotakkho makes one round trip on the route. According to BIWTA, each trip carries around 20 to 25 vehicles of various sizes and 60 to 70 passengers.\n\nContacted, Selim Reza, assistant engineer of BIWTA, said physical work has begun to recover the pontoon. \"Construction has also started for an additional pontoon at Banshbaria ghat. We hope to complete these works during the dry season,\" he said.\n\nAdverse weather and excessive silt accumulation on the route are the biggest challenges to maintaining regular ferry operations, he added.",

As a result, many people have been suffering during their daily commute.\n\nAccording to the Netrakona LGED office, the bridge was commissioned in 2021 and its construction work was awarded to Kishoreganj based contractors MS Mirza Construction and Mamun Construction JV with a deadline in August 2022.

A team arrested the two from Alambagh in Jurain around 11:15am yesterday, according to a press release.\n\nPappu's father, Montu Sheikh, filed a murder case with Kadamtali Police Station accusing four, including Uzzal and Yousuf, who are listed as narcotics traders, said Md Ayub, officer-in-charge of the station.\n\nUzzal was accused in three narcotics cases, while Yousuf was accused in two.\n\nThe OC said the initial investigation indicates there may have been prior disputes over drug-related matters. Over this, absconding accused Bapparaj and others shot Pappu dead as he went to the spot with Bapparaj's rival group.\n\nPolice are conducting drives to arrest Bapparaj, he said.\n\nSpeaking to this newspaper, Montu, who is also an auto-rickshaw driver, said his son worked as an auto-rickshaw driver.\n\n\"On Monday morning, Pappu went to visit his in-laws' house next to ours with his wife and children.

Russia is the top oil supplier to India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer.\n\nThe South Asian nation is set to lower its Russian oil purchases to at least a three-year low this month, after Washington sanctioned Moscow's top oil producer Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nRussia remains an important supplier of energy to India, Peskov told Indian journalists at an online media briefing on Tuesday, days ahead of President Vladimir Putin visit to India for summit talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTrade mechanisms that cannot be affected by third countries needed to be arranged, he said, adding that Russia has experience in doing trade under sanctions.\n\nIndian refiners, such as Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, have stopped buying Russian oil.\n\nState-run Indian Oil Corp has placed orders to buy Russian oil from non-sanctioned entities, while Bharat Petroleum Corp is in an advanced stage of negotiations for Russian oil imports.\n\nRussia-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy, partly owned by Rosneft, is exclusively processing Russian oil after other suppliers pulled back following British and EU sanctions. Russia wants India to continue to provide support to Nayara to boost its local sale and capacity use.\n\nReliance Industries Ltd, which used to be the top Indian oil client of Russia, has said it loaded Russian oil cargoes \"precommitted\" as of October 22, and will process any parcel arriving after November 20 at its refinery that is geared to produce fuels for the local market.",

        "full_news": "China has issued the first batch of new rare earth export licences that should accelerate shipments to certain customers, a source said on Tuesday, fulfilling a key outcome of the summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.\n\nThe approvals come after months of disruption triggered by China's introduction of rare earth export controls in April at the height of the trade war.\n\nBy forcing companies to apply for licences for each export, Beijing created shortages that brought parts of the auto supply chain to a halt and handed it enormous leverage in trade talks with Washington.\n\nThe new \"general licences\" are designed to ease that pressure by allowing more exports under year-long permits for individual customers, Reuters reported exclusively in November, and were a key outcome of the Trump-Xi meeting in late October.\n\nChinese magnet maker JL Mag Rare Earth has received general licences for nearly all of its clients, while Ningbo Yunsheng and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech have secured licences for some of their clients, the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe three firms and China's Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to questions.\n\nAll three companies sell to the automotive industry among others, according to their websites. JL Mag has a subsidiary in Europe and Ningbo Yunsheng says it has clients in Europe and the Americas.\n\nThe new licences will supplement but not replace the existing licensing regime, Reuters reported in November. For now, only large Chinese rare earth companies are eligible for general licences, but the criteria could widen if the rollout proves successful, the source said.\n\nThe new licences go some way to closing the gap between Beijing and Washington's respective accounts of what was agreed at the leaders' summit in South Korea.\n\nWhile the White House likened general licences to the effective end of China's rare earth export controls, Beijing has said little about the new licences in public and given no sign it intends to dismantle its regime.\n\nIt remains to be seen how widely licences will be issued and whether they will be off limits for some customers, for example defence or sensitive sectors such as aerospace or semiconductors.\n\nMeanwhile European firms on Monday complained again about long delays and a lack of transparency in the existing export control system.",

Both estimates are better than what was forecast in September.\n\nChina is set for 5.0-percent growth in 2025, 0.1 points above the September estimate. \"The global economy has shown surprising resilience in 2025,\" the OECD said.\n\nGrowth is, however, expected to soften during the second half of this year, as higher tariffs translate into higher costs for businesses and consumers, and elevated geopolitical and policy uncertainty continues to weigh on domestic demand.\n\nGlobal growth is then expected to recover through 2026, helped by the fading impact of higher tariff rates, favourable financial conditions, supportive macroeconomic policies and lower inflation, with emerging-market economies in Asia continuing to account for the majority of global growth.\n\nBut there are downside risks, as the outlook \"remains fragile\", the OECD cautioned. \"A further rise in trade barriers, especially around critical inputs, could inflict significant damage on supply chains and global output,\" it said.\n\n\"High asset valuations based on optimistic expectations of AI-driven corporate earnings pose a risk of potentially abrupt price corrections,\" it said, also warning that fiscal vulnerabilities may push long-term sovereign yields higher, tightening financial conditions and hampering growth.",

        "headline": "Are we giving up thinking to AI?",
        "full_news": "There has long been a fear that new technologies weaken human abilities. Socrates worried that writing would erode memory. Centuries later, people believed calculators would destroy mathematical skills, and many feared that the internet would ruin our ability to concentrate. Yet the concern surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) feels different. With AI now deeply integrated into everyday life, from homework help to professional decision-making, the question has gained new urgency: are we losing the art of thinking in the age of AI?\n\nAcross classrooms, workplaces and homes, AI has become both a convenient assistant and an almost invisible companion. Students routinely use AI tools to summarise chapters, draft essays and generate entire assignments. In universities, professors also rely on AI to design assessments, prepare teaching material and streamline administrative tasks. This has quietly become an everyday reality.\n\nAI can make knowledge more accessible, support learners who struggle and increase efficiency. But beneath the optimism lies an uncomfortable possibility. As machines grow more capable, human cognitive skills may diminish. When the first instinct is to ask a model for answers, abilities related to analysis and reflection weaken through lack of use. Over time, this may reshape not only how we learn but how we think.\n\nChildren are especially vulnerable to this shift. Cognitive development grows out of doing hard things, working through problems, forming arguments and dealing with ambiguity. These experiences are the foundation of intellectual maturity. If AI is introduced too early or used too heavily, children risk skipping the stages that cultivate creativity, resilience and critical thinking.\n\nIn universities, the core issue is integrity. If students allow AI to complete assignments without engaging with the ideas, their degrees no longer reflect real learning. If lecturers depend too much on AI to prepare course content, academic quality and originality may decline. The danger is not that AI will replace teachers or learners. The danger is that AI may replace the thinking that teachers and learners need to do.\n\nThis does not mean we should turn away from AI. A more useful question is how to ensure that AI strengthens rather than weakens human intelligence.\n\nThe answer lies in our approach.\n\nFirst, assessments need to be rethought. Traditional take-home essays and predictable problem sets no longer serve their purpose when AI can generate flawless responses. Educators need to emphasise in-class reasoning, oral examinations, real-world projects and reflective writing, formats where thinking cannot be outsourced.\n\nSecond, we must teach AI literacy, not only how to use AI but also how to question it. Students should learn to critique AI-generated material, identify inaccuracies and recognise bias. In this way, AI becomes a stimulus for critical thought rather than a replacement for it.\n\nThird, we must reinforce the idea of AI as a tool rather than a crutch. A calculator did not remove the need to understand arithmetic. It allowed mathematicians to move forward. In a similar way, AI can free people from repetitive tasks so that they can focus on creativity, strategy and innovation. This benefit appears only when AI use remains mindful, like a tutor who guides rather than a service that completes the task.\n\nWe should avoid framing AI as a dire threat or a future tyrant. The real risk lies not in machines taking control but in humans voluntarily surrendering their own thinking. Intelligence is more than the ability to produce answers. It involves judgement, interpretation and understanding. These are human qualities, and they sharpen only with use.\n\nAI will continue to evolve. Its power will increase. But the future of human cognition is limitless. If societies design educational and cultural systems with care, AI can elevate human thought rather than diminish it. Parents can support this by modelling mindful use and encouraging independent thinking.\n\nThe challenge before us is simple but profound: to use machines without allowing machines to use us.\n\nThe writer is chairman of Unilever Consumer Care Ltd",

        "headline": "Economy now in better shape",
        "full_news": "The country's economy is now in better shape than it was before or immediately after last year's mass uprising amid a dollar crisis, said Md Mahbub ur Rahman, chief executive officer of HSBC Bangladesh.\n\nThe senior HSBC official said the next phase of growth will depend on how well Bangladesh nurtures domestic demand, strengthens its infrastructure, and positions itself within shifting global supply chains.\n\nHe believes the current economic slowdown provides a strategic window for local businesses to build strength for the future.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Star, Rahman said, \"My take is that it [economy] is much better than what it was 15 months or 18 months back, but it should be much better than what it is today.\"\n\n\"We have to go a long way,\" he said on the eve of the British multinational celebrating 29 years in Bangladesh today. Apart from facilitating imports and public infrastructure financing, HSBC Bangladesh today caters to nearly 10 percent of the country's exports.\n\nRahman, the first Bangladeshi to lead the bank in the country since 2020, said HSBC is committed to helping the country unlock new opportunities for the next wave of sustainable, resilient and future-ready businesses.Speaking about shifts in global trade and supply chain strategy, he said three forces will shape Bangladesh's economic direction.He pointed to Bangladesh's large domestic market supported by remittances, strong demand for infrastructure in a densely populated country, and its geographic advantage as global supply chains realign across Asia and the Middle East.The first driver, Rahman said, is domestic demand, supported by a population of about 18 crore, nearly half of whom are under the age of 25. This young demographic creates a strong consumption base, much of it driven by remittances from Bangladeshis working abroad.\"The job is not in Bangladesh, but the job is actually outside. That money is coming to have disposable income for the family, so they go to the market. It is a huge infusion of that money going to the market,\" he said.Infrastructure is the second pillar. Rahman said a country of 18 crore people within roughly 55,000 square miles must continue to expand transport networks, logistics capacity and public services to support growth.\"When you have 180 million people within 55,000 square miles, what you need is more infrastructure, whether it is airports, whether it is ports, whether it is roads and highways, whether it is public transportation,\" he said. \"Something that probably we ignore is our riverways.\"He said stronger infrastructure improves efficiency, connects economic zones, brings down travel time, and speeds up business activity.Public investment also generates employment and circulates money through the economy. He emphasised careful planning to ensure that infrastructure spending delivers long-term returns.The HSBC Bangladesh CEO also pointed to digitalisation as an area where Bangladesh has made progress and should continue to build capacity.The third driver, and the one he considers most important, is supply chain reconfiguration.An MBA graduate from the Kellogg HKUST programme, Rahman said Bangladesh's geographic proximity to major economies gives it an advantage at a time when global buyers are diversifying.\"Whenever we talk about China plus one or China plus two, the question is how we are going to seize those opportunities. Supply chain is key. Bangladesh is geographically close to two large economies, China and India, and ASEAN. What we did not explore that much is the Middle East. Most of the cases, if not all, show that those markets are opening up as an export destination for Bangladesh.\"He said Bangladesh has strong connectivity, with major trade hubs in Asia reachable within a few hours of flying time.\"Within four hours, you can go to Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Guangzhou in China, two hours to Delhi, three hours to Mumbai, and half an hour to Kolkata. The question is, how do we tap those markets for our exports?\"He said HSBC has access to 90 percent of global trade flows and works with most large apparel buyers worldwide.\"Of the top 20 buyers, 17 are our clients,\" he said, adding that the bank helps connect international buyers with Bangladeshi suppliers. \"The connectivity helps, and the opportunity unfolds.\"Rahman said the country has long-standing expertise in garments, supported by strong relationships with global buyers.But he said diversification, value addition, and logistics readiness are increasingly important as export patterns become more fragmented and automated.\"Understanding buyers' strategies, consumer trends, and the rapid shift toward fast, multi-destination shipments is becoming essential for sustaining competitiveness,\" he said.\"What has got us here will not take us there,\" he added, highlighting the evolving nature of export logistics.Rahman described how contracts now require shipments to multiple destinations. Buyers run stores across the Middle East, China, ASEAN nations, and Europe, demanding faster and more precise rotations.\"Now the export is like $50,000 going directly to that shop, directly going to the rack. They are asking for rotations.\"\"Export has become hugely automated, digitalised, fragmented,\" said the official at HSBC, which has been recognised as the Best Trade Finance Bank for the seventh year in Bangladesh and eighth year globally in the Euromoney Trade Finance Survey 2025.He said Bangladesh exports most of its goods to the European Union, about one-fifth to the United States, and the remainder to other markets.EU buyers, he mentioned, often use Bangladesh as a hub for broader international distribution. \"We have to see our proximity and what our buyers' international strategy is, where they would be growing.\"Tariff parity is another factor. \"Bangladesh's tariff with other countries is still okay, as the tariff rate is not an outlier at this moment,\" he said.But the competitive advantages can be eroded by tariff and non-tariff barriers, he warned.\"We have to see whether we are able to add value in terms of what is expected by the importing countries and the consumers. Everybody loves their customers. We have to love our customers and understand our customers.\"Rahman said competitiveness depends on efficiency, sustainability, worker upskilling, capital structure, and deeper engagement with global buyers.\"Do whatever is in your control. Put that efficiency, because ultimately, we have to bring value to our customers. We could become uncompetitive by having the duty in place. But production efficiency, sustainability, upskilling the workers, understanding the value chain, and an appropriate capital structure are important so that profit does not get sucked up by the interest cost.\"On winding down HSBC's retail operations in Bangladesh, the CEO said the bank is exiting retail in other markets such as Australia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and New Zealand, while keeping operations in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the UK.According to him, some jobs will be affected, but the bank is redeploying staff where possible and helping others find external opportunities.\"We are not exiting Bangladesh but realigning our business here with our global strategy,\" he said. \"We remain committed to continuing our corporate and institutional banking businesses in Bangladesh, and we recognise the importance of being here for our international corporate clients.\"\"We are focusing on our strength,\" he added.Rahman stressed the need for stability and enabling policies. \"Any business, global or local, wants stability and certainty.\"\"The character of capital is that it actually wants consistency, stability, and return. Consistency is equally applicable to foreign investors and local investors. Having a coexistence of foreign and local, and a business-friendly environment, can only be ensured with a government that has a people's mandate,\" he concluded.\n\nRahman, the first Bangladeshi to lead the bank in the country since 2020, said HSBC is committed to helping the country unlock new opportunities for the next wave of sustainable, resilient and future-ready businesses.\n\nSpeaking about shifts in global trade and supply chain strategy, he said three forces will shape Bangladesh's economic direction.\n\nHe pointed to Bangladesh's large domestic market supported by remittances, strong demand for infrastructure in a densely populated country, and its geographic advantage as global supply chains realign across Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe first driver, Rahman said, is domestic demand, supported by a population of about 18 crore, nearly half of whom are under the age of 25. This young demographic creates a strong consumption base, much of it driven by remittances from Bangladeshis working abroad.\n\n\"The job is not in Bangladesh, but the job is actually outside. That money is coming to have disposable income for the family, so they go to the market. It is a huge infusion of that money going to the market,\" he said.\n\nInfrastructure is the second pillar. Rahman said a country of 18 crore people within roughly 55,000 square miles must continue to expand transport networks, logistics capacity and public services to support growth.\n\n\"When you have 180 million people within 55,000 square miles, what you need is more infrastructure, whether it is airports, whether it is ports, whether it is roads and highways, whether it is public transportation,\" he said. \"Something that probably we ignore is our riverways.\"\n\nHe said stronger infrastructure improves efficiency, connects economic zones, brings down travel time, and speeds up business activity.\n\nPublic investment also generates employment and circulates money through the economy. He emphasised careful planning to ensure that infrastructure spending delivers long-term returns.\n\nThe HSBC Bangladesh CEO also pointed to digitalisation as an area where Bangladesh has made progress and should continue to build capacity.\n\nThe third driver, and the one he considers most important, is supply chain reconfiguration.\n\nAn MBA graduate from the Kellogg HKUST programme, Rahman said Bangladesh's geographic proximity to major economies gives it an advantage at a time when global buyers are diversifying.\n\n\"Whenever we talk about China plus one or China plus two, the question is how we are going to seize those opportunities. Supply chain is key. Bangladesh is geographically close to two large economies, China and India, and ASEAN. What we did not explore that much is the Middle East. Most of the cases, if not all, show that those markets are opening up as an export destination for Bangladesh.\"\n\nHe said Bangladesh has strong connectivity, with major trade hubs in Asia reachable within a few hours of flying time.\n\n\"Within four hours, you can go to Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Guangzhou in China, two hours to Delhi, three hours to Mumbai, and half an hour to Kolkata.

Output has now risen to nearly 4 crore tonnes.\n\n\"Although the population has a little more than doubled, productivity has risen over threefold. This achievement should not be underestimated,\" he said.\n\nThe central bank governor noted that agricultural loans currently account for only 2 percent of total lending, and said the aim is to raise this share to 10 percent. The central bank has a fund of Tk 25,000 crore for lending to small and medium enterprises, although disbursement is limited due to weak capacity among banks, he added.\n\nMansur stressed the need for adequate credit for small farmers and rural entrepreneurs.\n\nStandard Chartered Bangladesh CEO Naser Ezaz Bijoy said, \"The real heroes of this country are our farmers.\"\n\nTheir relentless work, he said, ensures national food security.\n\n\"Although agriculture's contribution to the economy has declined, its importance has not. The country's food security, rural economy, and employment all stand on agriculture.\"\n\n\"Agriculture is not just an economic sector; it is the backbone of our nation's progress,\" he said. \"The inspiring stories of today's winners show how innovation, resilience, and collaboration can drive sustainable development.\"\n\nShykh Seraj, director and head of news at Channel i, said farmers and innovators continue to protect the country from food shortages despite climate challenges and global uncertainty.\n\n\"Amid climate change and global volatility, agriculture remains our strongest path to resilience,\" he added.\n\nHe said Bangladesh avoided food shortages even when the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine triggered a global food crisis.\n\nHowever, he noted that crops are often damaged due to transport problems and limited storage. Improving distribution and storage must be a priority to ensure food security.",

Total trade in goods stood at €22.2 billion in 2024, with an EU deficit of €17.5 billion, according to European Commission data.\n\nGarments and textiles accounted for nearly 94 percent of the EU's imports from Bangladesh that year, while the bloc's exports to Bangladesh were led by machinery and appliances (35 percent) and chemical products (23 percent).\n\nIn services, total trade amounted to €2 billion in 2023, with the EU holding a surplus of €0.8 billion. Combined goods and services trade reached €23.9 billion in 2023.\n\nAt the dialogue, EuroCham Bangladesh Chairperson Nuria Lopez said European businesses and diplomatic missions shared a common goal of expanding foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and addressing the trade deficit as Bangladesh prepares to leave the least developed country (LDC) group next year.\n\nShe emphasised the need for reforms across customs, logistics, standards, regulatory enforcement and import procedures, pointing to case studies presented during the meeting.\n\nRepresentatives of the EU private sector noted that regulatory predictability, transparency and digitalisation are essential if Bangladesh is to attract quality European investment and emerge as a competitive manufacturing hub, according to a EuroCham Bangladesh statement.\n\nSeveral European envoys echoed these concerns.\n\nDutch Ambassador Joris van Bommel called for predictable, consistent and transparent regulation alongside a \"modern image\" of Bangladesh to unlock opportunities in water, agriculture and logistics.\n\nDanish Ambassador Christian Brix Moller highlighted lessons from G2G and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects, stressing stronger governance safeguards, quicker resolution of regulatory delays and timely approvals.\n\nItalian Ambassador Antonio Alessandro pointed to growth potential in sectors such as ceramics, leather and design, underscoring the importance of innovation, technology transfer and engaging small and medium enterprises.\n\nSpanish Ambassador Gabriel Sistiaga Ochoa de Chinchetru described the EU as a reliable partner of Bangladesh and called for stability, rule of law, and fair competition to deepen ties.\n\nSwedish Ambassador Nicolas Weeks referenced Sweden's deep links with Bangladesh's garment sector and its push for sustainable fashion, calling for clearer regulations.\n\nFrench Ambassador Jean-Marc Séré-Charlet highlighted the long-term advantages of partnering with Europe and urged stronger action on good governance and profit repatriation to unlock untapped trade and FDI potential.\n\nGerman Acting Ambassador Anja Kersten welcomed ongoing reforms but stressed consistent implementation, improved vocational training, an updated agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and efforts to strengthen Bangladesh's global image.\n\nFrom the government side, Chittagong Port Authority Chairman Rear Admiral SM Moniruzzaman detailed ongoing modernisation initiatives, including digitalisation, the Bay Terminal and the Laldia project to accommodate larger vessels and support 24/7 operations.\n\nBida Executive Chairman Ashik Chowdhury said structural reforms, better investor grievance resolution and annual \"result cards\" were being prioritised, adding that Bangladesh aims to bring more European companies to set up local and regional operations.\n\nLutfey Siddiqi, special envoy on international affairs to the chief adviser, stressed the importance of a clear reform roadmap and early engagement with the EU ahead of Bangladesh's LDC graduation.",

His total cost, including the leased land price, was Tk 1.68 lakh.\n\n\"I harvested 170 maunds from the nine bighas. Fifteen days ago, I sold 50 maunds at Tk 1,300 per maund.

How do we survive?\"\n\nAman paddy was cultivated on more than 59 lakh hectares this fiscal year, around 3 lakh hectares higher than last year, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).\n\nAs of November 30, nearly 56 percent of the food staple has been harvested, equivalent to 1.05 crore tonnes of rice.\n\nBy contrast, in the previous fiscal year, Aman paddy was planted on 56.10 lakh hectares, producing 1.65 crore tonnes of rice.\n\nIn Khulna, farmer Bivash Mondol of Brittisholua village, Gangarampur union, said this year's paddy has grown better than last year, but the price is very low.\n\nMikhail Hasda, from Godagari upazila in Rajshahi, said he harvested 14-16 maunds per bigha, similar to last year. \"Last year, the season began with Tk 1,400-1,500 per maund, but this year it is only Tk 1,200, and now Tk 1,150. We will incur losses.\"\n\nTraders also reported similar concerns.\n\nMd Nurul Amin, a paddy trader at Dashuria in Ishwardi upazila of Pabna, said each maund of dry, good-quality paddy sold for Tk 1,200-1,250 last week. Currently, the best quality paddy is at Tk 1,180-1,200.\n\nThe government has set a procurement target of 50,000 tonnes of Aman at Tk 34 per kilogramme. According to this estimate, per maund will fetch Tk 1,360.  Traders attribute the declining paddy prices to rising imports.\n\nBarek Uddin, a trader in Bogura's Nandigram upazila, said, \"A lot of rice is being imported, so prices are dropping.\"\n\nMizanur Rahman, a trader in Gaibandha, said, \"With imports increasing supplies, prices will likely remain low for the next month, then rise again.\"\n\nBangladesh imported no rice in FY 2023-24. But FY 2024-25 saw over 14.36 lakh tonnes, the highest in a decade, according to the Ministry of Food.\n\nOn November 2, the ministry authorised 222 importers to bring in 100,000 tonnes of boiled rice, instructing them to market it by November 30.\n\nChitta Majumder, managing director of Majumder Groups of Industries, a leading rice miller and importer, said, \"Eight months ago, we imported rice worth Tk 90 crore at Tk 57 per kilogram. We haven't finished selling that rice, even at Tk 47 per kilogram. The international price of rice is currently low, which is why imports continue.\"\n\nAccording to a recent World Bank report, global rice prices have dropped to their lowest level since 2017. The decline is attributed to higher production and reduced import demand in key importing countries.\n\nThe report also said that in 2025, average global rice prices have already fallen by 31 percent, with a further 1 percent decrease projected for 2026.\n\nMajumder said extending the government deadline for imports could harm farmers and those who purchased rice at higher prices earlier.\n\n\"Currently, there is plenty of paddy in the local market, but few buyers. Every year, we buy 600,000-700,000 sacks from the domestic market, but this Aman season, we have not bought a single kilogram,\" Majumder added.\n\nAli Imam Majumder, adviser at the Ministry of Food, said balancing farmer prices with market stability for consumers is essential.\n\n\"If imports stop, rice prices could jump to Tk 80 per kilogram,\" he said, adding that farmers can sell directly to government silos if their grain meets quality standards.\n\nAs of December 1, food grain stocks total 14.75 lakh tonnes, up from 11.02 lakh tonnes the previous year, show government data.\n\nIn the retail market, fine rice is now at Tk 72-85 per kilogram, medium grain at Tk 58-68, and coarse grain at Tk 54-60. Over the past year, prices increased by 6.08 percent for fine rice, 1.61 percent for medium grain, and 8.57 percent for coarse rice.\n\nJahangir Alam Khan, a renowned agri economist, said the government's approach to managing the Aman paddy reflects a serious management failure.\n\nHe said that delaying imports when prices were high and then rushing to import during the harvest has disrupted the market and artificially pushed down paddy prices.\n\nHe added that the government's minimal procurement plan offers little protection for farmers, while allowing traders to purchase paddy at low rates.\n\nHe said imports should be suspended for now, domestic procurement should be increased, and policies must be revised to prevent further harm to farmers and ensure fair prices during the harvest season.\n\n[Our district correspondents from Pabna, Lalmonirhat, Thakurgaon, Narsingdi, Jamalpur, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, and Khulna contributed to this report.]",

This should have been much higher,\" he said, pointing to weak distribution channels and inadequate institutional capacity.\n\nHe recommended partnering with microfinance institutions or specialised banks so that loans reach the intended SMEs.\n\nThe governor also called for a dynamic online marketplace for BSCIC entrepreneurs, proposing a professionally managed e-commerce platform to directly connect producers with buyers, eliminate middlemen, and ensure fair prices.\n\n\"It must be updated continuously and operated professionally.

Motion capture, he argued, relies entirely on the labour, presence and emotional nuance of real actors, whose movements and expressions provide the foundation for digital artists.\n\nAfter describing motion capture as \"a celebration of the actor-director moment\", Cameron said, \"Go to the other end of the spectrum (from motion capture) and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character. They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"\n\nMentioning that AI is trained on things that are already in existence, Cameron said, \"You will innately see, essentially, all of human art and human experience put into a blender, and you'll get something that is kind of an average of that. So what you can't have is that individual screenwriter's unique lived experience and their quirks. You won't find the idiosyncrasies of a particular actor.\"",

        "full_news": "Just as individuals ensure healthier lives by following certain principles, corporations maintain sound management and accountability by adhering to defined governance standards—collectively known as corporate governance.\n\nCorporate governance provides the strategic direction, transparency, and accountability necessary for sustainable success, aligning the organisation's decisions and performance with the interests of shareholders and stakeholders.\n\nWhile a corporate governance framework guides an organisation's operations, the financial statements reflect those operations as carried out under governance principles.\n\nAuditors safeguard stakeholder interests by providing reasonable assurance that the financial statements present a true and fair view, making their role inherently linked to the governance framework, its implementation, and its resulting operational and financial outcomes.\n\nIn accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA), auditors perform their work using sample-based examinations, enabling them to form a reliable opinion on the financial statements.\n\nSample selection is driven by the assessment of audit risk, which is evaluated through an analysis of corporate governance comprising: (i) strategic guidelines/framework—board oversight and documented policies and procedures; and (ii) internal controls—the implementation of processes to ensure operational efficiency, reliable financial reporting, compliance with laws and regulations, and effective risk management.\n\nThus, evaluating the adequacy of governance is a fundamental part of the auditor's responsibility, underpinning the assessment of audit risk and the design of appropriate audit procedures.\n\nFor listed companies, auditors review the entity's compliance with the Corporate Governance Code issued by BSEC on 3 June 2018.\n\nThis includes the structure of the board as recorded with the RJSC; the qualifications of directors (including independent directors); the roles of senior management; the functioning of board committees; the conduct of meetings; governance of subsidiaries; the code of conduct; and the activities of the Audit Committee and NRC, along with restrictions on external auditors.\n\nRequired disclosures on the company's website and the separate corporate governance report are also examined.\n\nThese assessments, together with applicable laws such as the Companies Act, 1994 and securities laws and directives issued by BSEC, inform audit planning and execution.\n\nFor banks and financial institutions, auditors must additionally review prudential guidelines issued by Bangladesh Bank.\n\nFor insurance companies and other regulated sectors, relevant guidelines of their respective authorities are considered.\n\nIn the case of unlisted and private companies, governance evaluation is conducted under the Companies Act, 1994, complemented by internal policies and standard practices.\n\nIn line with the governance framework—covering governance structure, oversight responsibilities, and internal controls—auditors must assess audit risk for all types of organisations, including listed and non-listed companies, private entities, banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, and microcredit institutions.\n\nThis assessment is essential for designing appropriate sampling procedures. However, many auditors bypass this requirement and rely on a simplified, traditional approach, selecting samples without properly identifying operational or financial risks.\n\nAudit programs are often prepared with limited evaluation of internal controls, resulting in incomplete coverage and inadequate documentation.\n\nAs a result, significant risk areas remain unexamined, leading to poor-quality audits and weaknesses that emerge later.\n\nA recurring concern is that auditors overlook the Corporate Governance (CG) compliance report in listed entities, despite the need to review it before completing the financial audit.\n\nWhen prepared only afterward, the report cannot fulfill its intended governance purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, a robust assessment of corporate governance is essential for planning a risk-responsive audit.\n\nBy evaluating governance, oversight, and internal controls—and obtaining sufficient evidence—auditors can design an effective audit programme, ensure an efficient audit process, and issue a sound professional opinion on the adequacy of an entity's governance framework and its overall financial position and performance.\n\nThe writer is a fellow member of ICAB and a partner at Basu Banerjee Nath & Co., Chartered Accountants.",

We had a couple of chances to equalise and in the last second they scored the third,\" Oblak told Movistar.\n\nAtletico coach Simeone said his team gave their all and could not fault them despite the result which cut short their charge up the table after six straight league wins prior.\n\n\"I'm happy with the team's performance and we competed well,\" said the Argentine.\n\n\"We couldn't be efficient in front of goal, that's what we ask for but sometimes it doesn't happen.\"",
